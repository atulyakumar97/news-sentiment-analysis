COAL INDIA,new delhi  one and a half years after ongc bought a majority stake in it    corp ltd  hpcl  continues not to recognise the company as its promoter saying it will follow the government advise to list ongc as a promoter only after receiving clarifications from necessary agencies   oil and natural gas corp  ongc  in january last year bought the government s entire 51 11 per cent stake in hpcl for rs 36 915 crore  following which  hpcl became ongc s subsidiary   hpcl management  however  has continuously refused to recognise ongc as its promoter   in a regulatory filing hpcl made to stock exchanges on july 21  in the shareholding for the quarter ending june 30  2019  hpcl again listed ongc as  public shareholder  and not as its promoter   just like the previous five quarterly filings  hpcl listed  president of india  as its promoter with  zero  per cent shareholding  ongc was listed as  public shareholder   owning  77 88 crores  shares or  51 11 per cent  shareholding of the company   sources close to ongc said  it company   recognised larsen and toubro as its promoter within a day of the engineering giant acquiring a majority stake  but hpcl has steadfastly refused to acknowledge its new promoter  ongc   reached for comments  a hpcl spokesperson said   an advice  was  received some time back from government of india stating that  president of india  continues to be the promoter of hpcl and ongc is also to be shown as promoter of hpcl below president of india  hpcl being a listed cpse  clarifications  details were required from multiple agencies  authorities to ensure compliance to various stipulations applicable to listed companies including companies act  sebi regulations etc     as soon as all the clarifications details are received from concerned agencies  authorities  necessary amendments as required will be made in the regulatory filings after following due process  till such time  status quo is being maintained in the regulatory filings   the spokesperson said in an email response   while hpcl management has been unrelenting  oil minister   in written replies to questions in parliament had listed the company as a subsidiary of ongc   the government too has been treating hpcl as ongc subsidiary and its headhunter public enterprises selection board  pesb  on june 17  called ongc chairman and managing director shashi shanker to assist in selecting the new director  finance  of hpcl   sources said the chairman of ongc  as a result of it being the holding company of hpcl  by rule was invited to be on the interview panel to select the director   till now  hpcl chairman and managing director mukesh k surana would sit on the pesb interview panels for selecting directors   hpcl director  finance  j ramaswamy retired on february 28  and interviews for the post held by pesb on june 17 selected r kesavan  who currently is an executive director in hpcl  according to a notice put out by the government headhunter   for selecting the director of a company where the government or its controlled company has more than 50 per cent stake  pesb panel interviews shortlisted candidates  the panel is assisted by the secretary of the administrative ministry and the chairman of the company concerned   the department of personnel guidelines states that  in the case of subsidiaries  the full time chairman of the holding company is invited to assist the board    sources said going by these guidelines  ongc chairman and managing director was invited to sit on the interview panel to select hpcl director  finance     it is clarified that both hpcl and ongc are listed companies independently managed by their respective boards and the above issue does not have any impact on the functioning or the coordination between the companies  synergy groups of the two companies are working to identify synergy areas  some of which are acted upon and some are work in progress    efforts are directed to ensure that no value is lost for the stakeholders and further value is created by leveraging synergies  hpcl has always followed high standards of corporate governance and will continue to do so in future also   hpcl spokesperson added   sources said the government had earlier this year asked hpcl to add ongc as its co promoter but the oil refining company sought to delay it by seeking further clarifications   while the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ongc  a lack of it keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it gets full agenda of every board meeting of hpcl and can be aware of price sensitive information   according to the securities and exchange board of india s rules  the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company   when    ioc  had bought the government s stake in fuel retailer ibp co ltd  it was listed as the latter s promoter in every instance after the deal  the same was the case when ioc acquired a majority stake in chennai petroleum corp ltd  cpcl    since acquiring a majority stake in hpcl  ongc has only been able to appoint one director to that firm s board   sources said   ltd s governance structure  which the hpcl management has so often cited to allow surana retain the chairman and managing director designation  even though there cannot be two chairmen within a group  clearly provides for the holding company chairman to sit on the panel for selecting directors of subsidiary companies   coal india is a holding company and has seven subsidiaries  the board of each of the subsidiaries is headed by a chairman and coal india too has a chairman and managing director to head the board  but on pesb interview panels to select a director or chairman of subsidiary

lenders went ahead and sold the shares because they must have thought a possible default was imminent  the share prices collapsed  as per the agreement  mutual funds were supposed to either sell the shares or force essel group promoters to pledge more shares to ensure that the cover remains at the original agreed limit  but neither of this happened  instead  the essel group management reached an agreement with other lenders  including mutual funds  to get time till around september 2019 to arrange for funds  meanwhile  closed end funds such as fmps that have either just matured or are coming up for maturity in the next two months are in a bit of a soup  as and when they recover their money from the essel group of companies  they will pay it back to investors  those il fs securities where recovery is uncertain have been provided for  fund houses have written them off  in the meantime  thats a loss  on the other hand  fund houses are still holding out a glimmer of hope that essel group companies will pay up  back in january  as far as essel group debt securities are concerned  fund houses had no choice  there were 44 lenders at the time that had collectively lent rs 13 500 crore  according to what was heard on the street at the time  four lenders that had lent around rs 200 core collectively were known to have sold the zee group shares around 25 january that led to the share price collapse  zeels share price closed at rs 319 35 on 25 january  down from rs 434 10 a day before and dish tvs share price closed at rs 22 6  down from rs 33 60 a day before  if just four lenders could cause such havoc  we can only imagine what would have happened to the stock had all 44 lenders  that had collectively lent rs 13 500 crore   dumped their zee group pledged shares  why not mark down the security  but heres the tricky part  kotak amc  and we hear other fund houses are set to do the same  has not marked down the security  the fund houses reiterated that they have valued the securities as per the valuations that the two rating agencies  crisil ltd and icra ltd  provide on a daily basis to all fund houses  ideally  when a security defaults  which the two essel group companies did  or merely postponed payment  depending on how youd like to look at it    the fund houses are supposed to mark down the security and the net asset value shows a loss  here  kotak amc tells us that the affected fund houses voluntarily gave an extension to the essel group up to around september 2019 to come up with the money  hence  this is not a default  fund houses say  this means  on paper  investors have not suffered a loss  theyve just got a part  most  actually  of their payment now  from all the other assets that the fmp sold off  and the remaining payment will come as soon as the fund houses recover the dues  more so because the fund houses say they are confident of the sale of essel group assets and recovery of their own dues  but is that the right thing to do  to dissuade us from telling lies  our parents used to teach us that it takes a thousand lies to hide one lie  because you have to tell two lies to protect one  then four lies to protect the two and so on till it becomes unmanageable  the fund industrys mess reminds us of this  it was bad enough that they decided to take undue risks  then the situation got out of their hands when they couldnt sell the pledged shares  too many shares had got pledged by then so asking for more cover was not a viable option  if they sold the shares they already had and the share prices would have collapsed  with very little room left to manoeuver  they had to give an extension  will mutual funds get their money back  only time will tell  the essel group may have good brands  so there could still be hope of recovering money  but things could go either way  mutual funds have to go back to their drawing board and assess how much risk they ought to take  meanwhile  fund managers who stayed away from taking credit risks  and lost out to many of their aggressive peers in recent years  are now having the last laugh

DEWAN HOUSING,dewan housing finance corporation  shares plunged 8 percent intraday on february 26 after rating agency icra downgraded commercial paper programme and continued to keep thecompany on watch with negative implications  the stock was quoting at rs 132 95  down rs 3 75  or 2 74 percent on the bse  at 12 15 hours ist  icra said it revised the short term rating outstanding for the rs 8 000 crore commercial paper  cp  programme of dhfl to a2  from a1   as on date  dhfl has cp outstanding of rs 1 525 crore  the company has indicated to icra that it will buyback asubstantial portion of this amount over the next one month   the rating revision takes into account the moderation in the company s financial flexibility owing to challenges faced in raising funds from traditional bank lines and debt market instruments  and the consequent impact on the company s ability to generate fresh business   icra said  dhfl has been regular in meeting its debt obligations with repayments largely supported by sizeable securitisation and assignment of loan assets  with limited fresh business generation and sizeable securitisation and assignment of loan assets  the rating agency said the pool eligible for sell down has also been declining  thereby reducing the company s ability to refinance through securitisation  while the present resources  along with monthly collections  would be adequate to meet the scheduled repayments till march 2019  the liquidity position could get stretched in case of any acceleration of debt by the lenders and or higher than anticipated premature deposit withdrawals  according to icra  the rating agency feels the risk is further heightened by the moderate economic capitalisation levels  concentration risks arising out of 17 percent exposure  as a proportion of aum as on december 31  2018  to the construction finance segment  a large part of which remains under construction moratorium  and the reduced ability of dhfl to support fresh business  on the icra downgrade note  the company clarified saying the rating was for outstanding commercial papers of only rs 1 525 crore out of a rated amount of rs 8 000 crore  which forms less than 2 percent of the company s outstanding borrowings  company said in its borrowings  icra has rated only the short term instruments of company namely commercial papers  and post repayment of outstanding cp of rs 1 525 crore  it will not have any outstanding commercial paper rated by icra  since the liquidity crisis in september 2018  which had impacted the hfc nbfc sector as a whole  dhfl had been able to come out strong by discharging all its liabilities of rs 17 876 crore till december 31  2018that includes rs 9 965 crore of commercial papers  the company added  hence dhfl said this rating action is not merit based at all  especially at a time  when the company has demonstrated its overall commitments including asset sell down like it did with its stake in aadhar hfc  reducing cp exposures  etc  the company has plans to reduce the project loan book through portfolio sales  plans for selling its stake in non core businesses and onboarding a strategic investor  while the sale of stake in aadhar housing finance limited has been announced  it would be subject to regulatory approvals  icra said  the company has also been able to conclude thesale of one of its construction finance loans amounting to rs 1 375 crore ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dhfl-sinks-8-after-icra-downgrades-commercial-paper-programme-3583981.html,130.6,26-02-2019,136.75,DHFL,13:17,dhfl sinks 8  after icra downgrades commercial paper programme,moneycontrol
DEWAN HOUSING,the fact that bonds come with risk  perhaps lower than equities but even so  is now dawning upon us  at least the actions of some of the investors in non convertible debentures  ncd  of some non banking finance companies  nbfc  indicate so  some of these ncds are quoting at discount to their issue price in thesecondary market  for example   dewan housing finance  ncd offering 9 25 percent rate of interest till maturity in september 2023 quotes at rs 715 as against the issue price of rs 1000  though some experts reckon this as over reaction by investorsbut what are the lessons for the investors  the problems with nbfc bond instruments have been around for thelast few months  the asset liability mismatch is the chief culprit behind this  nbfcs have raised short term money by way of commercial papers and short term loans from banks to lend for long term  which includes home loans  once the short term funding stops  the nbfcs are squeezed  on the one hand  they have to repay the short term loans and commercial papers and on the other  their customers pay as per the repayment schedule over anextended period of time  to worsen the situation  the market forces tighten the liquidity situation  either these nbfcs do not get fresh money or they get it at a significantly higher price  i e   higher interest rates  since these nbfcs cant reprice their already given loans beyond a pointbut see their cost of funds going up  their profitability is expected to go for a toss if this continues for long period of time  which further shoo away investors  while the future is uncertain  some of the existing investors are trying to escape by selling their ncds at whatever price they get  some retail investors are overreacting to the issues faced by nbfcs and exiting the ncds at whatever price they get on the exchange  there are asset liability mismatch and other problems  but investors should not panic  says ajay manglunia  head of fixed income  edelweiss financial services  it is time to stay put and let clarity emerge  he points out that yields in the retail markets are quoting at afar higher level than the yield quoting at theinstitutional level in case of some bonds  this speaks for overreaction by retail investors  dhfl ncds are quoting at 17 percent yield on the exchanges but after the news of crisis hit the markets  dhfl managed to raise money at 10 percent to 10 25 percent  also  the asset sale has happened at yields closer to this level  here are some examples of bonds quoting at high yieldin thesecondary market  source  synergee capital  note  this isneitheran exhaustive list of bonds nor are investment recommendations  the uncertain environment has led investors to two questions  what should they be doing with their existing investments in these ncds and what should be the learnings from these investments  most fixed income experts say that youdo not have many choices if you are an existing investorin these bonds  the yields at which some of these bonds quote at the moment are absurd  nothing can be done  just hold on to the investments  says joydeep sen  founder of mumbai based wealth management firm wiseinvestor in  if you sell now  you book losses as you sell at a steep discount to the issue price  there are companies such as dhfl where the promoters have been honouring all their repayments so far and if they manage to raise funds the way they were doing in the past  there is a fair chance that the existing investors in ncds will be paid  he points out  in a note that axis asset management circulated among its distributors and advisors dated 31 january on its own investments in dhfl  it said that despite the liquidity crunch  after september 21  2018  the company has repaid loans of rs 17 876 crore  primarily funding the same through portfolio sell down  papers across issuers may see different outcomes as the situation unfolds further  though existing investors cant do much  there are a few lessons for investors in future  investors have woken up to a harsh reality in the last six months  the safe haven called fixed income investing has emerged as a minefield  investors have looked at debt as alow risk investment option  but they must understand the risk involved when they look for 2 to 3 percentage points more on bonds as compared to risk free bonds  if you do not understand the business risk  do not venture out for higher yields  says ajay manglunia  many investors are comfortable with a 10 percent or 20 percent fall in the prices of the shares they hold  the price erosion is a part of equity investing for them  but the same investors find it difficult to digest even 5 percent fall in the bond prices  fixed income instruments may aim to give you regular income  but not all come at a negligible risk like a fixed deposit  one fixed income instrument could be riskier than the other  the problem compounds when aaa rated or aa rated instruments delays or defaults on their interest payment commitments  investors must do their homework before investing  you cant rely on the credit rating issued by credit rating agencies  if you do not understand the business and cannot arrive at an informed decision then just stay out  says vinod jain  founder and chief financial planner of jain investment planners  jain says that the time has come for a change in the ways rating agencies give credit rating to investors  make investors pay for credit rating than the extant arrangement of issuer paying for credit rating  investors who understand the credit markets or have access to expert advice may actually end up taking informed decision going forward  however  most of the retail investors who lack the time and expertise to analyse the bond offering would find it difficult to invest going forward  in such circumstances  the investors would be better off investing in a diversified basket  since most small investors lack the skillset or lack the time to analyse  it is better to invest in minimum 10 names  more the better  no single issuer should get more than 10 percent of the investible sum  says joydeep sen  retail investors should invest in the top notch names such as  hdfc    lic housing finance  or the bonds issued by central government undertakings since there is alittle credit risk  says vikram dalal  founder and managing director of synergee capital services  investors from low income tax slabs can look for opportunities in fixed deposits  there are some opportunities to earn some extra money without taking much risk  for example  hdfc limited  the housing finance company  offers 8 19 percent returns for a deposit maturing in 33 months  whereas hdfc bank offers 7 4 percent for a fixed deposit of three years term  similar is the case if you are looking for government backed investments   state bank of india  five year fixed deposit offers 6 85 percent rate of interest whereas india post offers 8 percent rate of interest on national saving certificate maturing in five years

would be corporate earnings  except for few companies  earnings announced so far are much lower than expectations  with a dismal performance from auto  fmcg and banking   financials sector   we believe the sentiments may remain negative  hul has seen growth slowing to almost 7 quarters low  the auto companies are already in a bad shape and we believe this may continue for september quarter

fiscal  sbi posted a loss ofrs 4 875 9 crore  according to brokerages  loan and nii growth could be in double digits with lower slippages  but other income or non interest income may be quite strong   we expect loan growth of 17 percent yoy  led by growth in retail books and portfolio buyouts  nii is expected to increase by 10 percent yoy due to lower interest reversals and better recoveries from w off accounts  non interest income is expected to remain strong at 38 percent yoy on account of an improvement in the treasury performance and fee income   motilal oswal said  adding stress addition is likely to moderate to 1 7 percent levels  as it believes that most of the stress has been recorded in previous quarters  itc itc  which will also release numbers on august 2  is likely to show double digit growth year on year in revenue as well as profit in the quarter ended june 2019 backed by cigarette business  according to the brokerages  cigarette volume growth could be around 5 5 6 percent

banknow among private lenders after icici bank reported healthy numbers with improved asset quality and hdfc bank delivered stable growth  despite a little concern over asset quality ahead   most

event to watch out for would be the federal open market committee s two day policy meetingthat concludeson july 31  globally analysts mostly expect federal reserve to cut interest rate by at least 25 bps to help the economy grow in the face of trade wars and slowing growth  us gdp growth in q2cy19 was 2 1 percent  higher than street estimates but there was some clear impact of tariffs and trade friction   investors are now largely tracking the us fomc policy decision at the meeting scheduled at the end of july  dovish comments from the us federal reserve reinforced bets on the us central

the fortnight ended july 19  and foreign exchange reserves data for week ended july 26 will be released  technical outlook nifty50 recovered on july 26 to close marginally higher  resulting in the formation of a small bullish candle on the daily scale for the first time after bearish candles formed in the previous six consecutive sessions  hence the pull back rally could be extended in the coming session  but confirmation of same is possible only if the index closes decisively above 11 350 level because overall sentiment still remains in favour of bears as it formed bearish candle for three consecutive weeks  experts feel   the index has formed a big body bearish candlestick pattern on the weekly timeframe which implies bearishness to continue unless we see a close above previous

broader trading range in between 11 000 to 11 650 zones in coming sessions  amit gupta of icici direct expects nifty fall to pause near 11 200 11 000 level and the recovery from lower levels in the long series of august   certain nifty heavyweights have seen formation of short straddle strategy  which is supportive to the idea of rangebound market  however  pullbacks from the lower band of nifty range are possible  the highest call base of nifty is placed at 11 500 strike  the upsides can be seen up to these levels after seeing a sharp decline in july  the nifty futures open interest has declined from 19 million shares to 17 million shares  which shows liquidation of long positions in the recent fall and no major short build was seen in the index   he explained  he said volatility has

better than expected earnings by  dabur india  given current environment  all eyes will be on earnings of fmcg major hindustan unilever which is scheduled to be released on july 23  according to brokerage houses  estimates  the revenue growth could be in the range of 7 10 percent yoy on the back of around 6 percent volume growth in june quarter despite an expected slowdown in rural demand  this along with cost saving measures and operating leverage could boost operating income and profit  the volume growth in june quarter last year was 12 percent and in march quarter it was 7 percent  considering weak rural demand  6 percent is satisfactory  brokerages said  l t engineering   infrastructure major larsen   toubro will also declare its quarterly earnings on july 23  which are expected to be good on the back of execution but the order inflow could be muted compared to year ago  brokerages feel   l t received reasonable order inflows in the range of rs 13 000 crore 21 500 crore  which includes more than rs 2 500 crore in hydrocarbon  more than rs 7 000 crore in power  over rs 3 500 crore in water   effluent treatment segment  order intake during the quarter was impacted by slower pace of order awarding during general elections coupled with muted private capex   icici direct said  the brokerage further said l t s order backlog suggests better execution rate in the domestic market in q1fy20e and fy20  consequently  it expects the company s standalone revenue to grow 10 2 percent  ebitda to grow 13 5 percent with margin expansion  kotak  too  expects 10 percent growth in core epc execution in q1fy20 driven by infrastructure segment  11 percent   defence engineering  and heavy engineering  but it said power  e a and others segments could drag down revenue growth  tata motors and maruti suzuki the auto sector is expected to report weak earnings for another quarter in q1fy20 due to decline in volume amid subdued demand  tight liquidity  rising buying cost and pollution norms  hence  the sharp fall in vehicle sales is expected to reflect in all parameters from topline to bottomline levels  brokerages feel  nifty auto index fell nearly 5 percent against 1 5 percent increase in nifty50  tata motors was down 6 7 percent and maruti suzuki 2 percent during the quarter  according to brokerages  tata motors is likely to report a loss of more than rs 1 200 crore in june quarter 2019 and around 16 percent decline in consolidated revenue due to 22 percent fall in standalone  domestic  volumes and around 16 percent dip in jlr volumes yoy  key issues to watch out for would be current demand trends for jlr and outlook for key markets  update on cost cutting initiatives at jlr  demand trend in domestic markets and new product launch  and impact of forex hedge loss  in the case of maruti suzuki  brokerages expect double digit decline across parameters due to 18 percent yoy degrowth in volumes   revenues are expected to decline by 14 percent yoy in q1fy20  which will be offset by 4 percent yoy increase in asps due to an increase in costs owing to new safety regulations   kotak said  kotak further expects ebitda to decline by 42 percent yoy in q1fy20 led by rise in commodity costs  negative operating leverage and high fixed costs in the gujarat plant due to low volumes  icici bank the country s largest private sector lender

from agriculture   below investment grade portfolio would decline qoq and coverage ratio would improve qoq   it said  key things to watch out for would be outlook on asset quality and trend on further relapse from restructured loans  and growth in casa   retail term deposits  fiis   diis fiis sold around rs 3 000 crore worth of shares during last week  taking total net july outflow to around rs 8 000 crore thanks to finance minister putting surchage on super rich in budget and concerns over consumption slowdown along with asset quality headwinds  this was against consistent buying worth rs 79 000 crore in previous five consecutive months  as per data available on moneycontrol  on the other hand  domestic institutional investors remained net buyers to the tune of around rs 6 500 crore  lending major support to the market  hence going forward  the key thing to watch out for would be any revival in fii flow which could be possible only if federal reserve cut interest rate in coming policy meetings to support us economic growth and if june quarter earnings season hints at a major recovery in coming quarters or any major policy change to boost consumption growth  technical outlook the nifty50 has broken crucial support levels of 11 600 and 11 500 on closing basis  and even 11 400 intraday in the week gone by and formed bearish candle on the weekly scale  with the nifty correcting sharply  the bears seem to be in control and the sentiments are so bearish that the index could break 11 300 levels  though there is a possibility of relief rally initially in the coming week  experts feel   the weekly price action for nifty resulted in a sizable bear candle with lower high and lower low  signalling continuation of negative bias  breach of key rising trend line  placed at 11 530  and lack of faster retracement of preceding declining legs makes us believe that nifty is heading towards 11 300 levels  while stock specific action would continue as we sail through q1fy20 earnings and derivatives expiry of july 2019 series   dharmesh shah  head  technical at icici direct told moneycontrol  he said for the first time since october 2018  the index has retraced its preceding major rally by more than 61 8 percent  indicating extended consolidation going ahead  this development coupled with the shallow nature of pullbacks led him to believe that 11 600 11 650 will act as key hurdle going forward as it is the low of exit poll session and recent breakdown area  f o expiry on the option front  maximum put open interest  oi  is at 11 300 followed by 11 400 strike  which could act as support levels in near term while maximum call oi is at 11 600 followed by 11 700 strike which could be resistance levels  we have seen put writing at 11 400 and 11 350 strike while meaningful call writing is at 11 500 followed by 11 600 strike  hence  a major shift in oi concentration suggests a shift in lower trading range in between 11 300 to 11 600 11 700 zones and which could also be a range for coming f o expiry week  experts feel   the nifty succumbed to fii selling pressure and declined from the highest call base of 11 700  which remains a short term hurdle for the market on intermediate pullbacks  the index is heading towards 11 300 put strike  which gained open interest since the budget day   amit gupta of icici direct said   nifty future premium has reduced in the last couple of weeks  this translates into current profit booking trend in the market  it may still take some time for the index to start getting the momentum back   he added  india vix

ICICI BANK,net profits of nifty 50 companies could climb 29 per cent on year in the june quarter on expectations that some of the banks  which had shown significant asset stress a year ago  would perform better  revenue will likely expand 7 4 per cent and log single digit growth for the first time in nine quarters  reflecting higher base effect and slowing demand   banks  construction and cement companies  and capital goods makers are likely to do better  given the higher rate of loan recoveries  increased capacity utilisation at plants  and rising prices  automobile  consumer goods  metal and telecom companies are expected to report subdued earnings   the first quarter corporate results will have the large base of q1fy19 as an impediment  high frequency data in india for q1fy20 have been largely weak  although some respite was seen in steel and power generation in the first two months of the fiscal  said deepak jasani  research head  hdfc securities   the consumer space has also been facing a slowdown  compounded by tightness in the credit markets  said jasani of hdfc securities   operating margin is expected to contract by 100 basis points  one percentage point  to 20 9 per cent in the june quarter  but it will still be better than the 18 per cent operating margin of the march 2019 quarter   growth momentum for the rest of fy20 hinges on the pace of demand recovery in various pockets of the economy  rural and urban consumption  and industry   the economy continues to suffer from slowdown across sectors and tight liquidity  all eyes are now on the budget and the extent to which these concerns will be addressed  said jasani         earnings at auto companies will be under pressure for the second consecutive quarter owing to a sharp contraction in volume growth and lower capacity utilisation  volume growth of passenger cars  two wheelers and commercial vehicles dropped 10 22 per cent during the quarter following rising channel inventory  indias largest car maker maruti suzukis volumes fell 19 per cent in the quarter  while hero motocorps volumes dropped 12 per cent     the declining rate of fresh nonperforming loans at several banks is a major positive for the sector that has been battling poor asset quality for the past several quarters  state bank of india  axis bank and   should report profit recoveries  retail oriented lenders  such as hdfc bank and    may report a further slowdown in credit offtake  in lockstep with slowing consumer demand     capital expenditure by state governments and the public sector is likely to support the performance of capital goods companies  in addition  order inflows during general elections have been better than street estimates     the effect of rising cement prices was not fully visible in the previous quarter  in the june quarter  large cement companies are expected to benefit from the spillover effect of higher prices  also  cement production in may rose 2 3 per cent on year  revenues of ultratech  acc       and dalmia bharat are expected to rise by 10 15 per cent and net profit by 5 7 per cent    the june quarter results are likely to be affected by a slowdown in demand due to weak macroeconomic conditions amid water scarcity in rural india  fmcg companies are likely to post single digit volume growth  advertising spend may remain high as companies continue to invest in brands  the key factor to watch would be management commentaries on consumer demand in an environment of erratic rainfall and a broader economic slowdown     while the june quarter has traditionally been a good quarter for indian it companies  unfavourable currency movements and slower project ramp ups in some cases may affect top line growth  tcs and   are expected to report 2 2 5 per cent sequential growth in dollar denominated revenues  operating margins are likely to be under pressure     lower metal prices and slowdown in the local auto industry will likely affect earnings at metal companies  although a relatively weaker rupee may partially help offset the impact  prices of steel  aluminium and zinc have fallen by up to 25 per cent from their peaks of last year  which should hit profitability     pharma companies are likely to continue their improved performance seen in the preceding quarter  while there are no major positives  price erosion in the us market has peaked  aiding their performance in the key market  cost rationalisation on the r d front is likely to continue  sun pharma    and cipla are expected to register improved performances     a gradual decline in pressure on billing rates is the big takeaway for listed telecom companies  this may lead to a modest increase in revenue  but profitability may not improve much due to the intense competition

ICICI BANK,reserve bank of india  rbi  on june 7 issued a revised circular on the resolution of stressed assets  which most experts feel will bring much more clarity to the process  they also think it is a definite win win for both lenders as well as the borrower  rbi has said that lenders must resolve non performing assets  npa  over rs 2 000 crore within 180 days  the latest directions from the rbi retains the basic spirit of february 12  2018  circular as it mandates higher provisioning  bankruptcy options and not allowing any other resolution methods outside the new norms  a pti report said  the new norms provide a framework for early recognition  reporting and time bound resolution of stressed assets  the central bank said in a notification on june 7  in the revised norms on stressed assets  rbi has said that in case of a default by a borrower  lenders have to undertake a prima facie review of the borrower account within 30 days from such default  called the review period   this is a welcome step since there was a lag between noticing the default and then having a resolution to it  earlier it was mandated to identify it on day 1 which was actually a losing situation for the borrower  this was actually creating a stressful situation for the lender and the borrower  mustafa nadeem  ceo  epic research told moneycontrol  this new 30 day window will now actually put a cushion for the borrower  secondly  the powers that have been now given to lender brings a lot of clarity on the table  since it will now be able to identify the bad loans  study the books and make a concrete resolution for the same  he said  nadeem further added that it is a win win situation for boththe lender and the borroweras it brings logically much needed clarity  during this review period of 30 days  lenders may decide on the resolution strategy  including the nature of the resolution plan and how it will be implemented  the lenders can also choose to initiate legal proceedings for insolvency or recovery  in cases where a resolution plan is to be implemented  all lenders have to enter into an inter creditor agreement  ica  during the above said review period  also read    rbi revises npa norms  gives banks 30 days to review stressed loans even though the revised framework for resolution of stressed assets does away with the implementation of resolution plan for borrowers overdue by up to 30 days  the overall framework is positive and will continue to incentivise banks for accelerated resolution of stressed assets  karthik srinivasan  group head financial sector ratings at icra said  further incentives to reverse 50 percent of these provisions upon reference under ibc will incentivise lenders to refer such stressed cases to ibc for faster resolution  however  lenders may adopt a case specific approach for such reference  he said  srinivasan further added that even though criterion for upgradation of stressed account has been relaxed  which now requires at least 10 percent of debt repayments at the time of restructuring from 20 percent earlier  the requirement of an investment grade ratings by the external agency will ensure that upgradation is done only for viable cases  heres how brokerage firms reacted on the rbi circular  clsa  the rbi offers leeway to banks and the onus of resolutions is now on them  the new framework addresses banks concerns by giving four concessions  there is no rule based reference to nclt  the central bank gave an extra 30 days i e  a total of 210 days for implementing resolution plans  it will be a tad easier for norms for loan upgrades  the new norms may address the risk of nclt references to rs 1 5 2 lakh crore of loans  we prefer private corporate banks like  icici bank    indusind bank  and among psus  it prefers  sbi   deutsche bank  the new npa norms are likely to provide flexibility in the resolution process  we expect some pick up in the pace of resolution  overall  it is positive for banks  it could provide some relief to power companies  the new norms should help in expediting resolution for power sector lending  nomura  most changes to the resolution process for stressed assets are practical  the changes rightly incentivise banks to find a time bound resolution  rbi has mandated additional provisions of 20 35 percent if lenders do not find a resolution plan  the resolution would need a nod of 75 percent of lenders by value or 60 percent by the number of lenders  the revised framework eliminates the stringent rule of one day default  we prefer corporate banks as the credit cycle is peaking for larger corporate banks  the corporate banks have limited exposure to recently stressed names in nbfc infra space ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rbi-npa-norms-market-reaction-4077781.html,1784.7,10-06-2019,,AKZOINDIA,10:32,rbi revises npa norms  a win win situation for lenders   borrowers,moneycontrol

ICICI BANK,kotak institutional equities research sees banks showing further improvement in key metrics  impairment ratios are likely to decline led by lower slippages  recovery as well as high provisions for bad loans  recapitalisation would result in most public banks reporting a sharp decline in net npl ratios  nbfcs had a marginally better quarter than q3 as liquidity eased for retail players  slowdown in auto sales and increase in incremental cost of funding will weigh on q4 performance  it said  banks  stable performance overall kotak expects banks under its coverage to show stable operating performance  though the massive recapitalisation in public banks could result in banks lowering net npl ratios by making higher provisions  loan growth has been stable at  14 15 percent for the quarter with better negligible pricing pressure resulting in nii growth of 21 percent  treasury contribution is likely to be sharply lower qoq  asset quality will show further improvement  it added  among banks  kotak continues to maintain a positive outlook on corporate banks including  icici bank  and  state bank of india    indusind bank  would have a challenging quarter  due to il fs exposure  while the focus on  hdfc bank  would be on revenue composition  third party fees would be lower considering revision on upfront trail fees from mutual funds   yes bank  would see a sharp slowdown in business growth and the commentary from the new management would be a key monitorable  it said  asset quality to show further improvement  slippages to ease but credit costs would be high kotak feels that the unrecognised stress in corporate loans is negligible especially post il fs crisis as risks emanating from real estate are not too high  resolution through the ibc framework has slowed as several high profile cases could not reach a conclusion as anticipated earlier  however  progress continues outside through settlements upgrade write offs etc  in its note  kotak says that the governments recent capital infusion program would result in these banks choosing to make aggressive provisions to bring down net npls of a few banks to  6 percent  which gives them headroom to come out of pca  the research firm maintains its key theme on playing the recovery for corporate banks with a positive outlook on corporate banks like sbi and icici bank  indusind bank would have another quarter of high provisions  stress in retail loans remains unchanged and low  nbfcs  a tad better according to kotak  q4 was a tad better than q3 with improved liquidity for most nbfcs  while loan growth picked up in select segments  retail housing  lap etc   auto finance was weak reflecting the slowdown in volumes by large oems  sharp rise in incremental funding costs after september 2018 will likely reflect in lower nim for the quarter  seasonal trends suggest that asset quality performance improves in q4 though strong recoveries over the last few quarters set a high base  wholesale lending business continued to remain muted as many nbfcs continue to struggle on the liquidity front  after the sharp rally  kotak has revised rating on  lic housing finance  to  add  from  buy   fair value of rs 590  unchanged  and  muthoot finance  to  reduce  from  add  even as it raised the fair value to rs 600  system loan growth remains robust at 15 percent yoy as per the latest available data  february 2019  for the banking system  loan growth has maintained a robust pace of growth at  15 percent yoy  compared to 10 11 percent in 4qfy18  the pick up in the pace of bank credit has been driven by a sharp spike in retail loans and lending to nbfcs  growth in retail loans has been driven by strong uptick in unsecured loans like credit cards and personal loans  it said  the pace of growth in credit cards has seen a slight dip over the last few months  housing loans have seen a modest upward push to 20 percent yoy  there has been a slowdown in lending towards secured products like auto and commercial vehicle financing mainly on low growth in the industry  demand for commercial vehicles will likely pick pace in 1hfy20e on account of pre buying due to new bs vi norms  it added  the relative tightening of liquidity is resulting in an increase in the borrowing cost of alternative sources of borrowings like commercial papers and debentures  this has made bank funding for nbfcs an important medium to maintain liquidity resulting in a robust growth of lending to nbfcs at  50 percent yoy in january february 2019  corporate loan growth  though muted  continues to crawl upwards  up 5 percent yoy in february 2019   the research firm said  corporate loan growth remains muted according to kotak  corporate loan growth trends were broadly unchanged during the quarter as corporate loans saw tepid 5 percent yoy growth in february 2019 as per the latest rbi release  corporate loans continue to increase albeit a slow pace  slowdown in capex investments has led to lower fresh disbursements in the space  rising slippages from the corporate book from 2hfy18 1hfy19 clubbed with lower disbursements led to muted loan growth in this segment

ICICI BANK,as things stand today  unlike 2014 there appears a very slim chance of a single party coming to the majority after the general election  the market is factoring a coalition led by bjp and that remains the most likely scenario shailendra kumar chief investment officer atnarnolia financial advisors said in an interview to moneycontrol s sunil shankar matkar  edited excerpts  q  do you expect the nifty to rally 300 400 points from here on before elections or is it going to be rangebound amid geopolitical tensions between india and pakistan  a  nifty is trading in a narrow 5 percent range between 10 500 and 11 100 for the last four months  a decisive breakout beyond this range would require clarity on elections  geopolitical situations  money market liquidity and earning trajectory for fy20  other global triggers namely economic stress in europe and disappointment during the current earnings season in the us are added issues that market has to factor in before making a decisive move  fundamentally there are enough green shoots in terms of rising capacity utilisation and cleaner corporate lending environment that would help the market to climb various walls of worries  q  considering the current political situation of all parties  what are your expectations for general elections  a  we are in a highly fluid political situation and lots can change to the run up to the election  as things stand today  unlike 2014 there appears a very slim chance of a single party coming to the majority after the general election  the market is factoring a coalition led by bjp and that remains the most likely scenario  q  how do you read the december quarter earnings season  have you changed your estimates for q4 and fy20  a  just concluded q3 results were mixed  whereas topline growth has remained robust  the margin picture has further deteriorated  falling margin and subsequent lower net profit growth have surely necessitated a downward revision in earnings estimate for fy19  now we factor 9 percent earnings growth in fy19  but most of the downward margin revisions have been on account of cyclical factors like global commodity prices  extra provisioning by corporate lenders and some one offs  so going forward once these cyclical factors stabilise  the margin would recover and earnings growth will be robust in fy20  q  what are themajor sectors to look at after december quarter earnings season and why  a  december results have seen continued volume growth particularly on the rural side for fmcg  it has shown good growth on the back of better deal wins and rise in digital revenue contribution  but the stand out sector had been corporate lenders both on the public and private side  advances are showing good growth  net interest margin is stabilizing and more important slippage has reduced  most of the slippage is from the stressed book and the difference between the stressed asset and gnpa has narrowed  also  these corporate lenders very prudently have kept their provisioning higher to make their balance sheet strong enough to meet any fresh pocket of non performing assets in thecoming years  q  considering positive development between theus and china  do you feel trade war will end between both countries soon  a  after two successful rounds of talks between chinese and us officials  the united states is extending the fresh rounds of tariff that was set to be imposed from march 1  also  there are indications that the presidents of both nations would be meeting shortly to finally conclude a deal  if reforms in china

ICICI BANK,highlights the third quarter earnings of  icici bank  strengthens our belief that the bank is well on track on multiple fronts to deliver to targeted returns by june 2020  in fact  we will not be surprised if it revises targeted consolidated roe  return on equity  of 15 percent upwards in another couple of quarters  icici bank reported a very healthy performance for q3 fy19 with core pre provision operating profit  excluding treasury income   increasing by 14 percent year on year  yoy   however  rise in provisions led to muted headline number of reported net profit declining by 3 percent yoy  with bulk of problem assets already recognised till fy18 and in q1 fy19  the slippages or gross additions to non performing assets continued to trend downward in q3  however  our enthusiasm for the bank is not just limited to receding asset quality problems  there is more than a reason that makes us decisively positive on the stock  the bank has continued to improve its retail franchise  both assets and liabilities  icici banks balance sheet it is now comparable to best in class and is the first reason for our optimism with banks casa  low cost current and savings  deposits at 49 percent and retail loans at 59 percent of total loan book  banks adequate capitalisation is the second reason that makes us affirmative  in an environment where large a large part of the lending system has been crippled because of a shortage of capital  public sector banks  and receding liquidity  nbfcs   icici bank is well poised to leap ahead with more than adequate capital  third and the most important reason is expectation of improvement in return ratios  with the receding asset quality issues and provisions thereof  we expect the reported numbers to improve significantly from fy20 as the current year  fy19  remains a year of consolidation due to higher credit costs  and last but not the least  considering multiple levers that should help drive sustained improvement in roe  banks valuation is extremely attractive  with the stock currently trading around 1 5 times fy20e book  current valuations seems to be pricing in the most concerns and offers a favourable risk reward  key positives  overall advances growth stood at 12 percent yoy as healthy 14 percent growth in domestic loan book was partially negated by 5 percent de growth in international loans  a strong focus on retail lending has enabled icici bank to grow its domestic loan bookalmost in line with the system growth  despite cyclical weakness in the large corporate segment  retail assets grew by solid 22 percent yoy while corporate loans were almost flat yoy   the net interest margin  nim  for the quarter improved to 3 40 percent from 3 33 in previous quarter mainly due to better margins on international book while margins on the domestic book remained almost stable at 3 72 percent  fee income growth was healthy at 16 percent driven by retail fees which constituted 73 percent of total fees  provision coverage ratio  pcr  improved significantly to 68 4 percent  up 950 bps sequentially    this is much faster  than expected acceleration in banks earlier stated objective to improve pcr to 70 percent by june 2020  gross slippages to non performing assets declined in q3 to rs 2 091 crore which was very encouraging  thanks to contained slippages and higher provisioning  net npas declined to 2 58 percent compared to 3 65 percent in q2  the banks exposure to list 1 and list 2 of corporates undergoing resolution through national companies law tribunal  ncltl  declined at rs 3 816 crore and rs 8 828 crore respectively  pcr on the list 1 and 2 was very healthy at 90 percent and 72 percent respectively as at end december increasing the likelihood of write backs in future  additionally  the banks disclosed pool of loans to corporate and sme rated bb and below  potential stress  declined to rs 18 812 crore  equivalent to 3 3 percent of the loan book  which also include the il fs exposure  key negatives  casa  low cost current and savings accounts  ratio dipped marginally to 49 3 percent as at end december as growth in casa deposits lagged growth in term deposits  still overall performance on liability continues to be impressive   current stock price factors in known issues  valuation rerating to continue in may last year  management articulated its strategy to deliver consolidated roe of 15 percent while improving nnpa to 1 5 percent and maintaining provision cover above 70 percent by june 2020  with its 2020 vision in place  investors should expect much lower npa formation and normalised credit cost in fy20  mid teen loan growth  steady margin and a fast journey to reach roe of 15 percent  with a strong capital adequacy  tier i capital ratio at 15 14 percent   we dont see many constraints in delivering its targets  with a potential improvement in return rations  the current valuation of its core book at 1 5 times fy20e p bv looks compelling  in fact  icici bank is trading at significant discount of more than 30  40 percent relative to its closest corporate lending peer having similar asset quality issues  the indictment of chanda kochhar by internal enquiry committee doesnt alter banks growth plans  appointment of sandeep bakshi as ceo had lifted the cloud of management related uncertainty  q3 earnings indicate a clear sky making icici

ICICI BANK,the market fell sharply in the lastweek as the sensex and nifty corrected a percent each  underperforming global counterparts  earnings disappointment in itc and maruti suzuki  corporate governance issue at zee entertainment and profit booking weighed on sentiment  the selling in banks  auto  metals  infrastructure and fmcg stocks pulled the market lower whereas the rally in energy  defensives it and pharma limited weekly losses  earnings will continue to be the key theme this week as well  due to which there could be more of a stock specific action  apart from that  the most important event to look at would be the interim budget 2019  also  there would be expiry of january futures and options contracts  so volatility could be a major possibility in the coming week  experts said  adding any rally or sharp sell off could be because of earnings  globally  key things to watch out for would be ongoing trade talks between the us and china   investors will stay cautious ahead of the interim budget on february 1 and because of ongoing q3fy19 earnings season  volatility is expected to remain high  the interim budget will be the last one before general elections in april 2019  presented by the current nda government  rahul sharma senior research analyst at equity99 told moneycontrol  vinod nair  head of researchatgeojit financial services also said market may extend the rangebound movement as global risk factors like us china trade talks and growth concerns continue to gain investor s attention  the broader markets underperformed frontliners

interest income in double digits  but slippages may moderate and asset quality is likely to be stable in q3  profitability is likely to be supported by higher treasury income during the quarter  kotak securities expects nii growth of around 20 percent yoy and a loan growth of around 25 percent yoy  overall credit growth is picking up driven by portfolio buyouts  healthy retail and corporate growth  emkay said  adding nims are likely to be stable in q3but may look better in q4 on the back of heavy npa resolutions  slippages could be rangebound between rs 3 000 4 000 crore as uttam galva and essar steel minnesota has been resolved  exposure  rs 1 500 crore   emkay said  motilal oswal said net stress loans during q2fy19 stood at 5 9 percent of loans and are expected to decline further as incremental stress addition moderates  key issues to watch out for would be themovement of watch list accounts  outlook on asset quality and trend on further relapse from restructured loans  and growth in casa   retail term deposits  state bank of india   february 1  state owned and india s biggest lender state bank of india is expected to report good profitability in q3fy19 against loss of rs 2 416 4 crore in thesame period last year  loan growth is also likely to be in double digits and slippages may be lower sequentially as most of the stress has been recorded in previous quarters  analysts said  motilal oswal expects loan growth to pick up at 11 percent yoy led by growth in retail books and portfolio buyouts  it sees nii increasing 15 percent yoy due to lower interest reversals and better recoveries from written off accounts  motilal oswal said other income is likely to increase 30 percent yoy  primarily on account of an improvement in treasury performance due to sharp moderation in bond yields  this could support profitability   slippages to decline to  2 5 percent as recognition of bad loans is largely complete  gross npls could decline with  1  further resolution in power and steel exposures and  2  write off of bad loans  however  provisions would be high due to ageing of npls   kotak securities said  key issues to watch out for would be updates on the retail  sme and agri slippages  recoveries from theresolution of nclt accounts  and outlook on power assets and macro developments on assetquality  interim  union budget the key event of the week to watch out for would be interim budget  which will be presented on february 1 by the finance minister it will be the last budget before lok sabha elections  the budget session will start on january 31 and end on february 13  given the loss in recent state elections that could jeopardize nda swin in general electionsand unhappiness among middle class and trading community due to poor business growth and little tax exemptions in the past 4 years  there could be more populist measures with a deviation from thefiscal path   it s election year and financial prudence will take a back seat  the government has to prove to the people that it has their interest at heart and so the budget is likely to be populist with sops for farmers  the middle class  and small businesses   anurag bhatia  ceo and head of investments at minance said  prabhudas lilladher said some of the populist measures could be farm package  annual cash transfer on lines of pension for the families below poverty line  significant increase in standard deduction for the salaried employees or increase in limit under sec80c and higher tax breaks for housing loans  relaxation in corporate tax rate long term capital gains  etc  auto sales data automobile companies will declare their sales data for the month of december 2018 on february 1  so maruti suzuki india  tata motors  bajaj auto  m m  eicher motors  hero motocorp  escorts and ashok leyland are stocks to watch out for  the performance of sales for october and november were pretty mixed with subdued data from maruti suzuki india  hence any revival in sales would be key things to watch out for  f o expiry and technical outlook the futures and options contracts of january will expire on january 31 and traders will roll over their positions to february series  so there could be volatility in the coming week  experts said  maximum put open interest  oi  is at 10 800 followed by 10 700 and 10 500 strikes while maximum call oi is at 11 000 followed by 10 900 and 11 100 strikes  call writing was seen at 10 800 followed by 10 900 strikes and put unwinding was seen at 10 500 followed by 10 800 and 10 600 strikes  hence  option band signifies a lower trading range between 10 700 and 10 900  experts said   nifty short build which was not closed near 11 000 is getting rolled into the february series as well  as certain nifty stocks are losing sheen  the index may consolidate for a longer time   amit gupta of icici securities said  on january 25  nifty breached its noticeable put base of 10 800  if the index doesnt recover immediately  the expiry week may witness selling pressure on account of closure of put writing positions  according to him  the nifty50 ended the week 1 2 percent lower at 10 780 55 and formed bearish candle on the weekly chart that implies the index may continue facing resistance on rise around critical resistances  overall  the index has been rangebound between 10 700 10 980 for past many weeks and the same range is expected to remain in thecoming week as well  technical experts said   the index has closed below all the major moving averages50  100 and 200suggesting selling pressure  however  the ascending triangle formed on the daily chart of nifty suggests immediate support at 10 740  recent rangebound movement may persist as adx on the weekly chart remains below 20   shabbir kayyumi  head of technical research at narnolia financial advisors said  jaydeb dey of stewart   mackertich said the most critical resistance is placed around 10 980  however  breaking down 10 650 also looks unlikely as long as theglobal scenario remains favorable  he added  macro data government budget value and infrastructure output data for december month would be released on january 31  nikkei manufacturing pmi for january  foreign exchange reserves for week ended january 25  and bank loan and deposit growth for the fortnight ended january 18 will be announced on february 1  fomc meet the us federal open market committee will be meeting for two days starting january 29 to decide the federal funds rate that would be announced on january 30  most experts globally expect the federal reserve to hold rates not only in this meeting but also in the first half of 2019 amid chinese growth concerns  trade war issue  etc  hence  the target range for federal funds rate could be maintained at 2 25 2 5 percent and the commentary would be key to watch out for  after four rate hikes in 2018  the fomc announced to slow down the rate hikes pace in 2019 taking into consideration the slowdown in the global economic growth  hence

ICICI BANK,ravi krishnan in the chanda kochhar case  nobody comes out smelling of roses  neither the board of icici bank  nor the government  regulators  or the central bureau of investigation  cbi   a year after initiating a preliminary enquiry  the investigating agency has charged the former managing director and ceo of icici bank  her husband  his companies  videocon group md venugopal dhoot and a clutch of that group s firms in a first information report  fir   the cbi has alleged that these people conspired to defraud  icici bank  of rs 1 730 crore  the matter pertains to an alleged quid pro quo transaction involving deepak kochhar and dhoot  the fir says vn dhoot transferred rs 64 crore to nupower renewable managed by deepak kochhar on august 9  2009  a day after a rs 300 crore loan was disbursed to a videocon group company  chanda kochhar was a member of the panel which sanctioned that loan  on the face of it  and thats the clear conclusion drawn by cbi it appears to be a case of quid pro quo  this is  of course  just an fir  the first step towards an investigation and the subsequent filing of a charge sheet  but it does raise a question on what due diligence the icici board did before jumping to kochhars defence in the first place  on march28  2018  the board issued an unequivocal clean chit to kochhar  it announced an independent probe much later on may 30 and kochhar herself stepped down in mid june 2018  now  its up to the cbi to prove in court that the transaction was indeed a quid pro quo for sanctioning a loan  but thats beside the point  the fact that deepak kochhar had lots of transactions and joint ownershipwith dhoots firms  and the fact that chanda did not recuse herself from the sanctioning committee should have been enough for the board to pull up the ceo  that the board didnt do that is appalling  here  the role of the government and the regulator  the reserve bank of india  must be called into question as well  the conflict of interest allegation was raised by an investor arvind gupta as  early as 2016   he had written to the prime ministers office and rbi  but his complaints got little attention  did rbi investigate  did it call for an investigation by the board  these are questions that the banking regulator has to answer  if rbi had nipped this issue in the bud  then the kochhar case wouldnt have festered for so long  theres a third aspect  icici bank sanctioned some rs 1 575 crore to videocon group entities  in this  chanda kochhar personally was part of the sanctioning committee for two term loans of rs 300 crore and rs 750 crore  secondly  the fir says some of the loans to group companies of videocon was to help them repay their loans to the parent  it also said one of the loans to videocon industries was to refinance its existing loans and these violated the banks credit policy  no doubt  that suspiciously sounds like evergreening  but again the charges need to be proved  till here  the fact that chanda kochhars conduct in these matters needs to be investigated is a reasonable conclusion to make  but the cbi is spreading the net wide  the fir goes on to name a list of senior officials and board members who were part of the sanctioning committees for these loans and says their role may be investigated as these loans turned non performing  that sounds like a witch hunt and confuses a specific case of quid pro quo with a commercial business decision having gone wrong  and icici bank was not the only one whose loan was not repaid  remember that icici bank was part of a consortium led by state bank of india that lent rs 40 000 crore to videocon  that entire amount has turned bad  is that a lapse in due diligence by icici or all banks  in its zeal  cbi seems to have started questioning commercial decisions  the july 2018 chargesheeting of some retired psu bankers is one clear example  this zealous chargesheeting of all and sundry associated with a bad loan will lead to the return of fear psychosis among bankers  not a good idea when the countrys economic managers want to boost loan growth ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/opinion-cbi-fir-in-chanda-kochhar-case-raises-more-questions-than-it-answers-3436201.html,1725.1,25-01-2019,1725.2,AKZOINDIA,15:46,opinion   cbi fir in chanda kochhar case raises more questions than it answers,moneycontrol
ICICI BANK,a section of public sector bankers on thursday raised questions about the rbi seeking powers to regulate state owned banks saying it apparently failed to act against officials in the  icici bank  videocon matter despite claiming to have enough powers to deal with private sector lenders  against the backdrop of cbi on thursday naming former icici bank chief chanda kochhar and others in the alleged quid pro quo in extending rs 3 250 crore loan to videocon group  some public sector bankers wondered whether the central bank was treating issues at state owned and private lenders in a different way  on condition of anonymity  the bankers also claimed that while the rbi has been acting very promptly in penalising top officials of public sector banks even for procedural lapses  it appears that the relatively strong case regarding kochhar was not dealt with appropriately  in the case of punjab national bank regarding the over rs 14 000 crore scam by nirav modi  the lender s managing director and two executive directors were sacked on grounds of procedural lapses  an executive director of a leading public sector bank said  there seems to be different approaches by the rbi towards public and private sector banks  despite both handling public money  the official pointed out  while the issue of alleged irregularities in loan extended to videocon group has come under the scanner of multiple authorities  including the rbi  there has been no direct action taken by the central bank against kochhar before she stepped down last year  another senior official of a public sector bank said  raising doubts over the intent of the rbi in dealing with private sector lenders  an all india bank officers  confederation  aiboc  spokesperson said the central bank did not take any action against icici bank or its officials even after a law firm withdrew its report that had given clean chit to former ceo kochhar  after allegations of quid pro quo surfaced in 2016  law firm cyril amarchand mangaldas had given a report regarding the role of kochhar in the matter  however  the report was withdrawn last year amid a furore over the alleged irregularities in loan given to videocon group  kochhar resigned as ceo of icici bank in october 2018  further  the aiboc spokesperson raised questions over the rbi s differential treatment given to icici bank regarding the loan matter  saying the central bank decided to wait for an independent report before taking any action but that was not the case when it came to scams at pnb and bank of maharashtra  unlike their public sector counterparts  private sector banks do not come under the purview of the central vigilance commission  the spokesperson added  the all india bank officers  confederation  aiboc  claims to have around 2 5 lakh members  last year  former rbi governor urjit patel said while it has far more control over private sector banks  it has little say over public sector banks which look up to the finance ministry  the weak legal framework over psbs deters the central bank from exercising better control over them  he had said  patel s remarks had came close on the heels of government indicating that regulators were not accountable to anyone ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/psu-bankers-raise-questions-about-delay-in-rbi-action-against-former-icici-bank-chief-chanda-kochhar-3432971.html,1725.2,24-01-2019,1739.65,AKZOINDIA,20:39,psu bankers raise questions about delay in rbi action against former icici bank chief chanda kochhar,moneycontrol

to sips  taking a cue from this  we expect financialisation trend to continue despite the market volatility  moreover  lack of investment opportunities in other asset classes  especially in mumbai and ncr which account for  50 percent of the sips  we expect strong sip flows to continue  q  the sensex has grown like 100x in 32 years  at 15 percent cagr  do you think  2019 will also give us a similar opportunity to enter and remain invested for a long time to create wealth  a  equity as an asset class is well placed to provide superior returns over the long term  india is and will likely remain the fastest growing major economy over the next few years at least  also  we believe we are leaving behind the low corporate earnings growth environment and are at the cusp of a strong earnings recovery cycle  if you put all these together  i believe that there will be opportunities to generate superior returns over the long term  q  what are your views on public sector banks after the recent rbi report suggested that the headwinds in terms of npa mess could be abating  a  we expect a revival in corporate credit growth in fy20  albeit in the second half due to election related uncertainties   infrastructure sector  35 percent of industrial credit   is showing initial signs of recovery after a prolonged contraction and we expect it to lead the industrial credit growth over fy20 21  after the nclt resolutions  we also expect the credit cost to decline on an average by 70 80 bps for the banking sector  though the environment is improving for the sector  we continue to like private sector banks and only a select public sector banks  q  what is your call on small anf midcaps for 2019  how should one choose the right kind of stock for investment  a  we expect midcaps to outperform in 2019 on the back of a  valuation comfort as midcaps are trading at 8 percent discount to largecaps and  b  softer crude and commodity prices that can provide support to costs margins  nifty midcap 100 currently has a low net profit margin of 3 9 percent  and also spur earnings growth due to low base  among midcaps  we prefer low leverage and reasonably valued stocks with  a  earning visibility for the next two years   b  high quality efficient management  top brands  an industry leader  first mover advantage  and capital allocation discipline  and  c  location advantages  e g cement   q  given that brent is trading around  55 to a barrel  what is your call on omcs and aviation stocks  a  we estimate global refining capacity utilisation to be around 83 9 percent by cy19 and 84 2 percent by cy20  up from 83 5 percent in cy17 and 83 9 percent in cy18   nearing the historical level of 85 percent during cy04 06  which is likely to strengthen refining margin  we like omcs that are more into refining and diesel constitutes a major chunk of their refining output  the double whammy of rising crude and inr faced by aviation is now behind us  we expect the benefit of falling crude  which constitutes  30 percent of input costs and inr strengthening to improve rask cask margin and the whole of h2fy19 to benefit  q  tcs and infosys will kick start earnings season this week  what are your expectations from these two big names of theit sector  a  we expect  infosys  to maintain its margin guidance and continue to expect that the new band of 22 24 percent target to be maintained and also expect  tcs  to widen the ebit margin gap with infosys this quarter  no doubt  it had a strong price performance in 2018  but we think it is unsustainable in cy2019 due to headwinds in terms of receding rupee depreciation benefits and a slowdown in global growth outlook

now be happy to take your questions  adajania from idfc  please go ahead  ratings   upgrades are of   41 billion  of which around   19 billion issteel  based on the internal ratings which are done by the risk team of thebank  the other upgrades are spread across companies and includeone case in which there was a change in management whichhappened a few quarters back  because you had mentioned that as a concern last quarter  epc company and some other accounts  on the builder financeportfolio  we are monitoring that portfolio closely  as of now we arecomfortable with the portfolio  mahrukh adajania   just in terms of margins  again  you would have seen a lot of interestfrom npls  is that the reason why margins grew  quarter because the june quarter had quite a big impact of theresolution of one of the steel accounts from the list 1 of the nclt so we did have interest collection in the september quarter  but theamount while being large was smaller than what we had in the junequarter  mahrukh adajania   then what explains the increase in margin  rakesh jha   in terms of the margin  the funding cost has remained broadly at asimilar level in the september quarter compared to june quarter andwe have been able to improve the yields somewhat  the fact that wehave deployed some of the surplus liquidity on to the lending sidehas also helped the margin  as i mentioned earlier there has been anincrease in the funding cost that the system has seen fromseptember onwards and then going forward that will result in thefunding cost going up and we will be focused on trying to pass thaton to the lending side as well  mahrukh adajania   what about the overseas margin  they have been so volatile  sowhen do they stabilize  will continue to see this volatility in the current financial year andeven the september number that you see includes some benefit ofinterest collection from npls  i think as we get into the next financialyear is when we should start seeing some stability there  otherwiseyou will indeed find that margin to be volatile during the rest of thecurrent financial year  fy2020  rakesh jha   we would report that number as the collections happen  there is noestimate that we have on that  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of kunal shahfrom edelweiss  please go ahead  are there a few segments which get into the decongestion category  that was the focus area which we have continued at the bank in thecurrent quarter as well  in terms of opportunities  as you say  in thecurrent environment on the lending side  the opportunity is thereacross each and every segment on the retail side  on the corporateside and even on the sme side and you would have seen that thegrowth across each of these segments has been quite consistent inthe current quarter and at a relatively high level  the opportunitiesare there in each of the segments and we will  as sandeep hascommunicated  be focusing on risk calibrated profitable growth ineach of these segments  such  do we also see nims broadly bottoming out  or maybe wecould say it has already bottomed out and we should only seeimprovement hereon  second half of the current financial year  the funding cost will go upfor all the banks including us  and as i said we will be focused onpassing on the increase in funding cost on to the lending side but wewill have to just see how that plays out  so  i would not want to saythat margins have bottomed out for the system per se but our focuswill definitely be to ensure that we pass on all the increase that wesee onto the lending side  only with respect to the spv or even if we have any exposure to thespv level  we would have downgraded that as well as the entiregroup  how should we read into it  is this only the exposure to fewentities or this is the overall exposure to that group  billion out of that was downgrade in the drilldown list which is thepower  steel  rigs and those sectors  then there was downgrade thatwe had towards the group engaged in infrastructure as youmentioned and there were some other accounts  there is no specificnumber that we have given for any specific account  these are theaggregate numbers    8 21 billion is not pertaining to theinfrastructure company  it is pertaining to the drilldown list inaggregate  that is power  steel  rigs and these sectors which we havebeen disclosing separately  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of rakeshkumar from elara capital  please go ahead  rakesh kumar   firstly  what is the reason for the drop in the tier 1 capital by 60 bpsfor the consol entity  level  rakesh kumar   but that number is looking like a fall of 50 to 60 bps during thequarter  which is slightly on the higher side  and the overseas loan book  the overseas loan book has increasedsequentially in this quarter because of the rupee depreciation  rakesh kumar   the deposit cost is lower this quarter  so would this be only due tothe average casa being on the higher side or is there any otherreason  borrowings have gone up during the current quarter  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of pranavgupta from aditya birla sun life insurance  please go ahead  of deposits overall  that the overall term deposit growth for the bank is still relatively onthe lower side because we kept away from some of the higher costwholesale deposits as we had other opportunities of refinancing andthe borrowings have gone up  but again as i said  i think in thesecond half of the year  the liquidity would get still tighter and i thinkbanks would need to rely to some extent  on the wholesale depositsas well  pranav gupta   secondly  just a data question  could you help us with the absolutenumbers for ca and sa separately  rakesh jha   yes  it is there in the presentation  savings deposits are   2 074 76billion and current account deposits are   760 72 billion  agarwal from motilal oswal securities  please go ahead  what is the level for these assets that we will want to maintain in ourportfolio over the coming years  happy to grow the portfolio  we want to take the coverage  been moving the coverage has been increasing at a better pace thanthat  so on provisions  you are right that the write backs can happenand provisions can be lower in a particular quarter but it is verydifficult to kind of be sure of when that happens  and in the interimthere will still be some amount of ageing based provision that willcome in as the non performing loans move into the deeper bucketson the doubtful and the loss category  so that is the reason we aresaying that in the second half also the provisions will be elevated  socompared to any kind of a normalized credit loss  it will definitely bea higher number in the second half of the year as well  nitin agarwal   can you share the sma 2 number if possible  compared to the rest of the portfolio  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of gurpreetarora from quest investment  please go ahead  ratio has been inching up for last one year  so any steps areyou taking to shore up deposit growth versus the advances growth third and last question is there any retail loan mix that you have inmind  numbers should of course be much closer to 100 basis points kindof a number compared to 300 400 basis points where we currentlyhave been running  but beyond that for each segment  while ofcourse  internally we have numbers that we track and monitor theportfolio against  we have not separately disclosed that for each ofthe segments  on the credit deposit ratio  you are right that thenumbers have increased for us  i think it would have increased foralmost all the private banks  the way we look at this is not just purelyfrom a credit deposit ratio  we also look at the liquidity coverage ratiowhich we maintain comfortably higher than the minimumrequirement of rbi which is 90   we are closer to 110  on that  the sme side  gurpreet arora   is it fair to assume that the 100 basis points credit cost can beachieved over next two years  maybe fy2021  migration to ifrs or ind as  if that happens  it could happen earlierthan that  presentations back  so we still hold on to those targets  the interim like we again mentioned in the last call  that our focus isto increase the core operating profit for the bank within the riskparameters  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of akhileshgupta from reliance nippon life insurance  please go ahead  making our fcnr deposit competitive in line with currencydepreciation  market is and what is the all in cost comparable with the domesticmarket  so  that is the calibration that we do on a regular basis  now  depending on the opportunities and the market rates  we would seehow that fits in  in terms of our cost  rates in the light of tight liquidity conditions  deposit rates  we had increased it in september quarter once and wehave increased the mclr  the lending rate  also a couple of times inthe last quarter  so these rates are calibrated based on the liquidityand competition  our expectation  as i earlier said  is that there wouldbe some increase in these rates in the second half of the year  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of adarshparasrampuria from nomura securities  please go ahead  adarsh parasrampuria   a question on liability  can you just quantify the retail termdeposits as a percentage of our total term deposits  for wholesaleterm deposits what have you seen rates go up by  where the wholesale deposit rates are  the wholesale deposit rateshave really gone up above 8  and then it depends on everyday andevery week in terms of where the rate is for the banks  we have notseparately disclosed the breakup of term deposits into retail andwholesale  but a larger proportion of the term deposits would indeedbe the retail deposits  adarsh parasrampuria   it will help if you can quantify it given that it is so sensitivenow that the wholesale funds have increased by a larger quantum  itwill be great if you can just indicate broadly what is the mix wouldbe  rakesh jha   sure  so going forward we would consider doing that  so is it not very logical that the nim improvement could end up beingpretty sharp over the course of next two to four quarters for casaheavy bank like ours  stage that may have an impact on the retail deposit rates as well  soit is very difficult to kind of commit on that  and given the currentliquidity scenario as you see  the funding cost will go up  i think asharp increase in margin for the banking system in the next coupleof quarters may not be the way it will play out  quickly maybe in the third quarter itself  if i take a little more longeronce rates stabilize say even at levels where we are today  once thathappens  i think it will seep into margins maybe after a couple ofquarters right  because only like 25  of your funding would bewholesale and rest is retail which is not going up by the samequantum  deposits is too high  banks may end up increasing the cost of retaildeposits  so we will have to just see how it plays out  margin start maybe next year onwards  would you infuse capital ifthat helps the margins or you have fully written off the bad loans just wanted to understand mathematically as to what the turningpoint would be there  happen within the bank itself  but i think more importantly  there arenon performing loans and we are indeed hoping to collect some ofthem  timing is a very difficult thing to estimate there  the interestcollections from npls are by definition going to be lumpy  forexample  in this quarter we had interest collection on the overseasbook and after that the margin is 5 basis points  so without that itactually would have meant that interest expense was higher than theinterest income just given the level of npls which are there  becausewe have not grown the book in the last two or three years  that kindof compounds it more from a margin perspective  so as i said  as weget into the next financial year  hopefully we should see morestability on the margin there  premchandani from uti mutual fund  please go ahead  of nbfc lending  opportunities for lending to nbfcs and hfcs and for buyingportfolios from them for priority sector purposes or even otherwise so these are options and opportunities that we are looking at  all ofthese of course have to be within our risk appetite  so we are opento lending to nbfcs and hfcs and even buying retail portfolios fromthem  relationships which were like going back to two decades and all that how sure you are that similar kind of name lending will not be donein the next credit cycle  and i think over time it will show up in the numbers as well  amit premchandani   but just the approach towards lending to big names and assumingthat all will be well because of the names that approach will changepermanently for you  m a financing that we had done in the past  so you are right that interms of the approach  it is going to be more granular and betterrated exposure  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of mayankbukrediwala from goldman sachs  please go ahead  of that provisioning coming back  of provisions for banks including for us  as i mentioned earlier  therewill be further provision that comes in because of ageing of some ofthese loans based on the rbi guidelines which are there  overall it isvery difficult to kind of comment on the quantity and timing of thewrite back of provisions on the portfolio  we are hopeful that weshould get reasonable amount of write backs on some of theseloans  but we will have to just wait and see when that happens  mayank bukrediwala   so at an overall level on the entire nclt  we do expect writebacksto come in  like we expect lgd to certainly be less than 70   frankly within the hands of the bank  it is the process under nclt we have seen only one or two resolutions which have happened yetand bulk of the interest has been on sectors like steel and cementand a couple of other names  especially in the list 2 that rbi hadgiven out to banks  there is a lot more of exposure to power sectorand some epc companies where the recovery may not be that good so we will have to just see how that plays out through the ncltprocess  mayank bukrediwala   just wanted to get a sense on the loss we have recorded on theuk bank subsidiary  just some color on that  also in terms of assetquality  what are the npls in that at the moment  have talked about on the domestic and the overseas branches book so that is where we are in terms of the uk portfolio  so for thecurrent year  we will have to closely monitor that and see how it playsout  in terms of the aggregate net npl at the uk subsidiary  it wasabout  190 million as of september 30  2018  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of sachinkumar from vashisht capital  please go ahead  sachin kumar   sorry  i missed the first 30 minutes  could you share what is yourexposure on the infrastructure company  exposure which is there  it is a part of the exposure that has gotdowngraded and it is a part of our overall bb and below portfoliothat we disclose  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of pranavtendulkar from rare enterprises  please go ahead  because i see that your retail engine has actually started workingvery well  so things like credit score  say things like how manycommon people are there in the retail liability side and asset side are there pricing differentials for various things because those thingswill be important and those things will matter after sometime  our credit cost  second  what we also do is that all the cases that weare not able to do  which do not pass through a filter  with a lag ofsix months or one year if they have taken a loan outside  we are ableto figure out whether our rejections are proper or improper  properis if the credit cost was higher on that portfolio which we left out  imust share that internally we are quite satisfied with what we reject  pranav tendulkar   sir  what is the business banking sub vertical in the retail  anup bagchi   business banking loans are of typical size of   10 to 10 5 million  theyare small ticket business loans and all of them are collateralized  pranav tendulkar   so the collateral will be the property or business cash flows  property  pranav tendulkar   are all these a sole banker relationship  anup bagchi   yes  for   10 million loans there are generally no multiple banks  prana v tendulkar   because that portfolio is actually growing very fast and it will be verygood roe accretive if you can manage the risks  anup bagchi   yes  so far so good  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of krishnanasv from sbicap securities  please go ahead  technical write offs  how soon do you need to get to 100  on yournclt list 1 purely from an ageing provision perspective because bulkof your npas would be residing in the d1 category or beyond d1category  so just a sense of how soon will you need to hit 100  justbecause of the ageing related provisions  100   so that will be distributed over the next several quarters interms of the portfolio moving from that 40  provision requirementbucket to 100  provision requirement  lot of that would indeedcome in the next financial year if we were to continue as per the rbiguidelines and indian gaap  rating buckets  a broad sense of what you rate aa and above versuswhat you rate just below that  and that is what will be considered under ind as for making theprovisions on the stage 1 and stage 2 category  so beyond that ithink once we kind of move over to ind as is only when we can givemore details on that  moderator   thank you  ladies and gentlemen  due to time constraints  that wasthe last question  i now hand the conference over to themanagement for closing comments  rakesh jha   thank you for your time this evening  anindya and i will be availablefor any further questions that you may have

PI INDUSTRIES,it was yet another week of consolidation for our markets in the absence of major triggers  the index started off well with some hope of surpassing the stiff hurdle of 12 000  but once again the attempt turned unsuccessful  during the remaining part oflast week  the index kept oscillating around the lower end of the range to eventually conclude a tad above the 11 800 mark  although the markets consolidated last week  the overall bias remained on the negative side  and hence any intra week pull back was getting sold into  now  with this price development  we can see the trading range getting shrunk further  whenever this happens  we will get a breakout  on either side  from the congestion zone  on the lower side  11 769 is the level to watch out for  any sustainable move below this could trigger a sell off and the index is likely to head towards 11 600 11 550 levels  however  looking at the broader picture  we are still hopeful and expect the market to break out in the upward direction  on the higher side  11 950 12 000 has become a sturdy wall  at this juncture  the pragmatic strategy would be to stay light and wait for a breakout from the mentioned range to create aggressive positions  meanwhile  keep focusing on individual stocks that are providing better trading opportunities  here is a list of two stocksthat couldoffer 7 10 percent return in the next 14 21 sessions  pi industries   buy  target  rs  1170 05  target  rs 1250  stop loss  rs 1128  upside 7  despite the overall broader market destruction  this stock has been maintaining its sturdy structure for a long time  on friday  this stock bucked the trend and in the process managed to give yet another breakout to clock fresh record highs  if we look at the volume activity  it has risen substantially  providing credence to the price development  we expect this outperformance to continue and fresh leg of the rally to unfold in days to come  thus  we recommend buying at current level for the target of rs 1250 and a stop loss should be fixed at rs 1128  wockhardt   buy  ltp  rs 387 25  target  rs 424  stop loss  rs 373  upside 10  the entire pharmaceutical space has been undergoing a difficult period and there has been no respite even after underperforming for nearly four years now  the nifty pharma index is trading at its multi year lows and on friday  we saw some signs of near term bounce  some of the larger peers rebounded sharply to provide some ray of hope for this beaten down sector  we like wockpharma because it has been making valiant efforts to surpass its hurdle of rs 400  which would unfold a strong upward rally  but before this  we have been witnessing some buying at lower levels and hence  with an anticipation of a breakout  we recommend buying at current levels for a target of rs 424 and the stop loss should be fixed at rs 372   the author is chief analyst  technical   derivatives  angel broking ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/podcast-stock-picks-of-the-day-market-lacking-clear-direction-wait-for-a-breakout-4103231.html,1169.85,17-06-2019,,PIIND,08:36,podcast   stock picks of the day  market lacking clear direction  wait for a breakout,moneycontrol

PI INDUSTRIES,performance of companies in the agrochemical space remained largely mixed in q3fy19  few companies like  pi industries    upl    sharda cropchem  and  insecticides india started showing green shoots with improved performance  however  others such as dhanuka agritech    rallis india  and  coromandel international  continued to be hit by global raw material supply shortage and weak domestic demand  of the agrochemical stocks  we find pi industries and insecticides india on track for growth and would recommend to keep these on radar and accumulate for long term portfolio in a staggered manner  key industry trends domestic market growth remains muted   performance in the domestic market remained largely muted  the rabi acreages were down due to deficit northeast monsoon and low soil moisture content  despite a normal monsoon and a healthy crop production in the preceding kharif season  crop yields remained low due to lower than msp  minimum support price  sale price of produce  this resulted in a stressed cash situation with farmers impacting domestic volumes  while the domestic demand growth remained muted  the export segment of companies showed growth  high raw material costs   margins of most companies continued to be impacted due to high raw material costs  since 2017  a large number of chinese agrochemical manufacturers were driven out due to stricter environmental norms which resulted in raw material shortage thereby pushing up prices and impacting margins  price hikes remained limited due to high inventory in channels and stressed competitive landscape  however  most management indicated there has been a relative easing in the supply situation with new suppliers coming in different parts of the world  backward integration    companies such as rallis india  tata chemicals  insecticides india etc  have also taken steps towards backward integration in order to reduce supply anomalies  bring cost savings and take advantage of the scarcity situation  improvement in the supply situation should be positive for the margins of the companies  new product launches   banning of 20 chemicals in 2018  that kicks off in 2020  resulted in an expectation of reduced volumes for companies with exposure to these products  however  most companies are working towards greener chemistry and have a healthy line up of product launches in the upcoming year  products launched in 2018 have also seen a good response  government initiatives   there has been a lot of focus from the policy front in order to support the farm sector and improve farm incomes  while on paper the new policies favour the overall development of the industry  a lot of it would be dependent on the grass root implementation  implementation of the msps remained weak in the kharif season  strong implementation stands to benefit the sector  stocks pi industries    strong q3 with healthy growth in topline and margins  the product pipeline is rich along with a strong order book and a debt free balance sheet  the export business has seen a strong upsurge and we expect this to continue  insecticides   india   encouraging growth in q3  a healthy line up of new products to offset the impact of molecule ban  three of the company s molecules  around 15 percent of topline in the ban list   high demand for banned products to benefit near term volumes  backward integration to smoothen input costs and supplies and strategic shift to high margin branded products to improve margins  upl   healthy q3 results  though the net margins were impacted due to one off exceptional expenses  while the synergies related to the arysta deal will start benefitting the performance after 2 3 years  we see expenses and higher leveraging to impact margins in the near term  substantial exposure in various geographies increases the weather and currency related risks  sharda   cropchem   non core belts division drove a healthy q3  operating and net profits too reported a strong improvement on a consolidated basis  china supply disruption has been a major overhang on the stock  though there is an expectation of some relief on that front  we believe it would take time before it normalizes  dhanuka agritech   q3 performance was disappointing with margin contraction  new launches  price hikes and branded portfolio to drive growth in future  asset light model facilitates concentration on brand development  more than half of its sales come from speciality molecules with higher margins  low penetration of herbicides and fungicides in india augurs well for the companys growth  rallis   performance continues to be impacted due to high input costs  speciality products with higher profitability should help improve margins announcement of capex  which was not there since past 3 4 years   suggest that the group might turn around from the current mess in the long term  however  the company is currently impacted by the external operating environment  and we believe the overhang would continue in the near term  coromandel international   disappointing performance with margin contraction owing to increased input costs and inability to take sufficient price hikes  though we expect the pressure on margins to continue in the short term  we expect improved growth in the long period owing to the growing share of the non subsidy business  greater operating leverage and visibility of growth in the crop protection business  outlook after a period of an adverse operating environment  the industry situation seems to be stabilising a bit now  with projections of a normal south west monsoon in 2019  we expect the performance of the sector companies to improve  with clearer inventory channels  companies are better positioned to take price hikes to a certain extent  the overall policy environment is also favourable for the sector and improved farm incomes would benefit volumes  follow  ruchiagrawal the market podcast   poor earnings  fii

for july  all these factors will sway market this week   however  analysts see stock specific opportunities in pockets of the market  based on their recommendations  here are 12   that can potentially deliver healthy gains over the next 11 21 sessions        this stock has almost formed a higher bottom on the daily chart  taking support at the significant 50 dma  which lies at around 72  the stock has been maintaining a positive bias  the rsi has also been on the rise  with the chart looking attractive  we anticipate a decent rise from here on for the stock to scale rs 88 90 levels in the coming days  with good volume participation  we recommend a buy rating on this stock  parekh said     this stock has formed a double bottom pattern on the daily chart at around rs 332 level and has seen a decent bounce  it has moved past the previous peak of rs 385  which is also the 200 dma  thus signifying a positive bias  we expect the stock to rise in the coming days  with rsi on the rise and good consistent volume participation  we recommend a buy rating on this stock  parekh said       the stock has validated the hammer candle pattern formed on the weekly chart in the previous week  moved above the candles high   which is the confirmation of a bullish reversal  the price is in a larger upward retracement leg from the low of rs 97  in which two legs were completed and third rising leg is on the cards  apart from this  it has formed higher top and higher bottom in smaller degree  which is a bullish dow signal  more upside is expected in the coming days  in addition  the price is well above the key moving averages of 21 and 50 day ema  and this could add strength to the bulls     the stock price has validated an engulfing bull pattern on the weekly chart in the previous week  which confirms a bullish signal  the price pattern has completed a major three wave decline from rs 782 to rs 648 with an irregular wave b  in that move  the stock has formed a double bottom around rs 648  interestingly  that is the zone for change of polarity  now  the stock is in a rising leg from the low of rs 648  which could head towards a new lifetime high  in addition  the price is placed well above the important 21 day  50 day and 200 day emas  and this could add further strength to the bulls        this stock peaked in the last quarter of 2017 in the rs 280 284 range and after forming a minor double top  it was in a sideways trajectory  the stock has been consolidating in a broad range after having stalled its upward move  it has been forming a good base in the rs 195 210 zone  currently  it rests at its 100 wma after pulling back from those support levels  the rsi is neutral against the price  showing no divergence  but it is marking higher bottom and moving out of a pattern  the weekly macd has shown a positive crossover and is now trading above its signal line  indicating a bullish signal  the prices have pulled back after forming a reversal candle near its pattern support  some upward move in prices cannot be ruled out  we expect the stock to test its upper range of the channel  any move below rs 200 will be negative for the stock  vaishnav said     this stock has exhibited strong signs of an end to the corrective move and signalled a potential trend reversal  after peaking out near rs 795  the stock has witnessed a corrective move over the past few months  while making subsequent lower tops  it is also showing signs that point towards a likely trend reversal  while the stock saw a sharp corrective decline  on balance volume or obv did not fall  the bottom is forming in the rs 530 550 zone  and the recent pullback from the immediate lows has been accompanied with higher volumes  a fresh buy signal has emerged over stochastic on the weekly charts with a bullish divergence against the price  an upward price revision cannot be ruled out over the coming days  any move below rs 520 will be negative for the stock        pidilite has seen a breakout from the downtrend line resistance and is moving in an upward sloping parallel channel  momentum indicator macd is in buy mode  both on the daily as well as weekly charts  the stock seems to have completed a wave iv correction and wave v up seems to have started  hence  we recommend buying this stock  said thakkar     axis bank has seen a breakout form the symmetrical triangular pattern on the monthly charts with a buy crossover in momentum indicator on the monthly chart  which is an absolutely bullish indication for the medium term  with this  the stock seems to have completed a wave iv correction and wave v up has started     lupin has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily charts  and seems to have completed the right shoulder of the same  the stock has again started forming higher tops and bottoms  which is positive in the short to medium term  it is likely to test the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern on the upside from here on  hence  we recommend buying this stock  the analyst said       after a multi month correction from the high of rs 226 registered in august 2017  this counter appears to have formed a durable bottom around rs 174 last july  the subsequent rally from the low of rs 174 to a recent high of rs 194 also retraced 38 2 per cent  thereby creating a short term bottom of rs 184  if the trend has changed for good  then it should scale much higher levels in due course  hence positional traders should buy this stock for an initial target of rs 207 with a stop loss below rs 184 on a closing basis     after a multi quarter underperformance from the high of rs 1 247 registered in august 2015  this counter appears to have hit a bottom last month at a low of rs 613  as it tested the lower boundary of the two year old downsloping channel  subsequent price action with sharp rallies suggests the counter is back on the radar of the bulls  traders are advised to make use of the current correction to create fresh longs at current prices and add further on declines around rs 740 for a projected price target of rs 798  stop loss is suggested for the trade below rs 735 on a closing basis     this counter has registered a strong technical breakout on massive volumes above its 100 day moving average from where all the pullback rallies got sold off on multiple occasions in the past  hence  sustaining above rs 77 level can potentiality lift the stock to its logical target of rs 99  positional traders are advised to buy this stock for a target of rs 97 with a stop loss below rs 75 on a closing basis

TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES LTD.,mumbai  with the plan to merge tata steel europe  tse  with german giant thyssenkrupps steel unit in the continent abandoned  the brass at tata sons and tata steel may seek to recalibrate the latters highly leveraged balance sheet through sizeable asset sales  this may include exiting some international markets  said top officials close to the development   the other immediate option would be to offload    tcs  shares as has been done before  one of the officials said   analysts are concerned about the minimal options available to tata steel  which has a total debt of over rs 1 lakh crore     having banked on transferring tses debt of rs 19 000 crore to the jv from its own balance sheet  tata steels growth plans could get disrupted  they said     about two years ago  the company had a rights issue  and if in trouble they could have another  said one of the persons  at the current price of rs 487  tata steels share price is below the rights issue price of rs 510 and significantly below the partly paid price of rs 615 of shares issued in february 2018  the stock went to a high of rs 720 then  this will really upset the minority shareholders who participated in the issue   tata steel officials didnt respond to queries   the two companies said on friday that they were scrapping the merger plan because it wasnt likely to win regulatory approval from the         tata steel acquired corus in 2007 for  13 billion at the peak of the previous steel cycle and at a high valuation  its acquisition of bhushan steels assets last year was at the peak of the latest steel cycle  although the valuation was not as high  analysts said  still  tata steels offer for bhushans assets at rs 35 200 crore did raise some eyebrows  they said  however  it was part of the wider strategy to focus on the domestic market   the company had hoped to gain room to raise money for expanding its india business  which had become the priority  offering higher growth  greater profitability and  most importantly  better regulatory protection  analysts said   tata group officials said the plans failure meant that the enormous effort that went into the exercise since september 2017 had been a waste  the m a team at tata sons and the top management at tata steel had hoped to close the deal in march 2019  worries started cropping up as the delay began  the group had no plan b  said a senior executive seeking anonymity     tata steel and   signed definitive agreements in june 2018 to combine their steel businesses in europe to create a 50 50 joint venture company that would be the continents second largest steel company after ln mittals arcelormittal  experts said investors such as   and liberty seemed to have done better on the acquisition front   the tata groups virtues are becoming its limitations  they bought assets at a premium whereas they should have bought it at deep discount like mittal  said a top fund manager seeking anonymity  adding that the merger plan with thyssenkrupp was too complicated a deal  there were far too many clearances required where they could get tripped  thyssenkrupp too had been under attack by activist investors   a tata group executive close to the development said  tata steel will just have to monetise some of their good assets  what has happened is sheer bad luck   steel prices are trending down with chinese producers flooding global markets  having dropped by over 15  since peaking at the end of last year   global scrap prices are at a three month low  scrap prices are good lead indicator for future price direction  said rahul jain  metals analyst with systematix  scrap weakness is a bit surprising given that iron ore prices are at highs  also  in domestic markets  demand is weak  especially for flat products  of which auto is a big end user   auto sales in india have slumped over the past year   analysts are worried that the european business will drain cash generated by profitable operations elsewhere   we are still upbeat on tata steels domestic story with a decent possibility of incremental capex being funded via own cash flows  said amit dixit of edelweiss  however  the operating environment in europe is challenging and with the european business back in the fold  we believe profitable domestic operations may have to support the european business  which is not cash neutral     lowering the amount of money tata steel owes would improve its estimated debt to ebidta  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortisation  ratio from four times to three  providing room to borrow more and invest in the indian operations  tata steels immediate peer jsw steel has a debt to ebidta ratio of two times  the scuttling of the jv plan could slow the companys expansion plans  tata steels capital expenditure was rs 9 000 crore in fy19 and it had guided another rs 8 000 crore for fy20  excluding europe operations    the european commission had opened an in depth investigation into the proposed merger in october last year over concerns that the deal between the two may reduce competition in the supply of various high end steels  following an agreed extension last month for further negotiations  thyssenkrupp confirmed that it had submitted a substantial offer to the european commission  the executive arm of the economic bloc   tata steel had said on friday that based on the feedback received from the agency  it is increasingly clear that the commission is not intending to clear the proposed joint venture as it expects substantial remedies in the form of sale of assets of the proposed venture   the proposed joint venture  thyssenkrupp tata steel was to have a total workforce of 48 000 employees across 34

TATA MOTORS,the indian economy is showing clear signs of a major slowdown and any effort to revive the same in the   will not be complete  unless the issues in the hinterland are resolved    with indirect taxes out of the ambit of the union budget  the governments annual fiscal roadmap has largely ceased to be material for stock investors  they now only look for policies and schemes that can have trickle down effect on any sector or stock   and the rural theme  with implications for a number of sectors  is in focus this time around   the agriculture sector contributes about 17 per cent of indias gdp but employs over 50 per cent of the total workforce  and thus has a key place in the demand supply equation   economists point out that despite various efforts by the government  gross value addition of the agriculture  agri gva  sector has been declining in recent times and the share of investment to agri gva has been falling consistently  see chart    therefore  there is a need to make some structural changes in agriculture starting from marketing to exports to double farmers income by 2022   an over 30 per cent slump in bse auto index since the union budget  unveiled on february 1  2018 against a 10 per cent rise in benchmark sensex has been partially attributed to a rural distress  which has also dented demand for fmcg goods  the bse fmcg index is up just 5 per cent    the gap between rural and urban growth came down to 10 per cent in fy19 from the historical median of 30 per cent   addressing rural distress and boosting consumption in the economy are expected to be a key focus of finance minister nirmala sitharamans full   on july 5  and should that happen  it may give fmcg and consumer sector stocks an easy lift        the rural economy is facing the heat of the slowdown due to a heady mix of lower realisations for farm output and slowing demand  says mayuresh joshi  portfolio manager angel broking   management commentaries of consumer staples fmcg specifically hinted at moderation and sluggishness in rural consumption  he said    the agriculture sector has been one of the focus areas since the first tenure of the nda government  some of the steps taken by the government included introduction of a crop insurance scheme  a mission to improve farm productivity  a scheme to plug holes in the procurement system and hiking of minimum support prices for crops to 1 5 times the cost of production besides a revolutionary income support scheme    there are hopes that the forthcoming budget will have a plethora of measures for the agriculture sector which can boost consumption linked stocks    arun thukral  md   ceo  axis securities  believes the government may look at providing interest free credit cards to farmers  as mentioned in its election manifesto  for short term new agriculture loans up to rs 1 lakh at 0 per cent interest rate with tenures of 1 5 years on the condition of prompt repayment of the principal amount  he expects the budget to have schemes that would benefit pharma  banking  fmcg and housing finance stocks   sbi ecowrap report said financial institutions and the government should lend their helping hands to farmers by providing market support right from cultivation to sales   the report also highlighted that capital formation in the agriculture sector has stagnated significantly  a trend reversal there can help achieve the objective of doubling farm income by 2022    this can be achieved by providing an incentive to agri term loans for investment purpose through an enabling mechanism of either interest subvention or credit guarantee fund  it said   at present  the crop insurance scheme called pms fasal bima yojana  pmfby  covers three types of crops  namely food crops  cereals  millets  and pulses   oilseeds  annual commercial or horticulture crops  which account for only 30 per cent of the total crop loans of banks    government should cover all types of crops under pmfby  which will help banks manage risks and also make a statement of intent in the budget to increase income support from rs 6 000 to rs 8 000 over next five years  this will create a feel good factor and boost consumer sentiments  the sbi economic research said   consumption related stocks like emami  lt foods  bajaj hindusthan  vadilal industries  prataap snacks and future consumer are down over 20 per cent since union budget  2018  however  stocks like nestle  hul  marico  britannia and dabur are up between 12 per cent and 60 per cent in the same period   none of the stocks in the bse auto index has delivered positive return to investors since february last year     tvs motor     hero motocorp  maruti suzuki    and m m are down between 20 per cent and 60 per cent   two factors can help improve rural demand  first  the monsoon and schemes or measures that the government is expected to announce in budget to stem deteriorating rural demand  any revival in rural sector will boost stocks like colgate and itc  said mustafa nadeem  ceo  epic research   the two stocks have delivered a meagre 1 per cent return to investors since february 1  2018   parth nyati  coo   co founder  tradingbells said even a minor increase in rural income can benefit fmcg stocks like hul  dabur  britannia  nestle  while any significant improvement in rural income can lead to demand growth in auto sector  especially for tractors and two wheelers  which can be a positive for escorts  m m  heromoto  tvs motor

TATA STEEL,it was not a start that a managing director would wish for  but tv narendran had no choice  the first crisis hit within two weeks of him taking over at the helm of  tata steel s  india and south east asia businesses  in november 2013  there was a huge explosion in jamshedpur  the company s iconic steelmaking facility  it was a heavy dent on a company that prided on its safety record and employee welfare  asnarendran said   it was a huge issue  and had never happened   the crisis was just one of the many that were to come  a little over a year later  the government passed the mines and minerals  development and regulation  act  which temporarily closed down mines of tata steel  the company was forced to import iron ore  again a first for the steelmaker  just when things were getting back to normal  and tata steel got to reopen the mines  china   the world s largest steelmaker and consumer   went into a tailspin in 2015   within six months  steel prices went to the levels of 2003   recalls the tata steel chief  if the start was not great  the end of his first five year tenure was marked byanother serious setback  the proposed joint venture with thyssenkrupp  which would have merged the european businesses of the two companies   couldn t clear the regulatory hurdle   it was called off earlier this year   sometimes things work your way  sometimes they dont  one has to keep chin up and move on   narendran told moneycontrol in a recent interview in mumbai   we never like to waste a crisis  we want to become stronger coming out of a crisis   he added  chin up  he did  over these five years  and despite the many setbacks  tata steel has become a leaner company by expanding its india business  and shedding much of the weight of its european operations  from 18 million tons  the european unit now makes 10 million tons of steel  the uk facility  a bigger part of the challenge  now manufactures 3 million tons a year  down from the earlier 11 million tons  the rest comes from the more profitable  netherlands based unit   today we are seen as a very serious player in europe s auto industry which was not our reputation a few years back  in fact  the jv with thyssenkrupp may have been cleared if we hadn t been such a strong player   said narendran  one of the objections raised by the european commission  which was investigating the jv  was over the monopolistic position of the venture ineurope sauto sector  in india  the annual capacity has grown to 18 million tons over the five years  especially thanks to the acquisition of usha martin and bhushan steel  equally important was the commissioning of the kalinganagar facility   which was in the works for over a decade   in 2016  the achievements were noticed  and narendran   who tata group insiders said has the backing of chairman n chandrasekaran   was elevated as global ceo   managing director of tata steel in 2017  his second tenure comes up for shareholders  approval in the upcoming agm on july 19  the unlikely candidate narendran s appointment as the tata steel md was a surprise for many in the industry  not because he lacked the qualifications  after completing his engineering from national institute of technology  tiruchirappalliand mba from iim calcutta  narendran joined tata steel in 1988  as a trainee  but while his predecessors were  operations guys   narendran was seen as a marketing veteran  who had spent considerable years outside india  just before taking the top job  he was heading the south east asia business  the choice though has helped refocus the company to produce more of what can be sold profitably  in some of the segments  it now operates like  a consumer durables company   bringing in highermargins  personally too  narendran has eased into the role  even as he shuttles between jamshedpur  mumbai and europe  the 54 year old manages to keep aside time for himself  a 5am riser  narendran goes for 10k runs    am not chandra  the chairman  who is a known marathoner    he clarified with a chuckle  in jamshedpur  the wicketkeeper turned all rounder turned batsman   my arms don t let me bowl anymore   manages to squeeze in an innings or two  what he misses most is his labrador zoey  whom he prefers to keep in jamshedpur   a flat in mumbai would be too constraining for her   irrespective of the location though  narendran has managed to continue some of his most passionate initiatives  including the informal meetings with company s young executives  it was a practice he started in singapore  where he was heading the south east asia business   as you become more senior you get disconnected from people on the ground  and these are not people you would see regularly in meetings   said narendran  it helped in several ways  one he was able to engage young professionals below 30 years  who have been most prone to leave the company   our attrition rates are highest with people who have spent less than five years in the company   said the global md   ceo  second  these conversations sparked new ideas  while the company s lgbt policy was developed and framed after one such meeting  another gathering highlighted the need for a further and wider cultural change   once  i had a group breakfast meeting with the youngsters and one of them asked me   pioneering is one of our values but all the pioneering stuff you are talking about was done 100 years ago what is the pioneering stuff that you are doing now   it was a very valid question   recounted narendran  the next five and that is what narendran wants to do in the next five years of his tenure as tata steel s global md   ceo   to me the last five years havebeen about dealing with the challenges and also dealing with the structural strength of tata steel  that ball is rolling and will continue to roll  thenext five years is more about cultural issues and new businesses   he said  among the new business  tata steel has  ventured into scrap recycling   a first for a major steelmaker in india   these are to me seeds that we are planting for the future   says narendran  about the project that he accepts is close to his heart  the new vertical  called new materials business  will also manufacturefibre reinforced polymer that are used inauto and infrastructure sectors  another big initiative is to make tata steel among the top 5 in the world in r d   we have a team working on that   he said of the transformation project that will take at least five years   if you see south korean steelmaker posco  they were nobody in technology  but today they are one of the leaders   overall  he wants tata steel to be agile  a difficult task otherwise for an organisation that is as colossal as the steel company   tata steel is a battleship  you cant drive it like a power boat  but at the same time the world is becoming more volatile  so you need to be agile    so  to me these are the changes that we want to drive in tata steel over the next few years

TATA STEEL,when paresh shah bought shares of  tata steel   he had done so with a lot of conviction that the stock would eventually move up  however  after six months  he found that despite all the pep talk from his broker and the rosy picture painted by analysts  the stock was still trading below his purchase price  what is more concerning is the fact that the stock was not even showing signs of momentum  what can paresh do at this point in time  frankly  that is not too complicated  tata steel represents a solid business from a reputed business group and has rewarded investors in the past  paresh himself is convinced that the stock is a good investment and is willing to wait  but  waiting has a cost and that cost is in the form of lost opportunities  can paresh make his investment productive in such a way that he at least earns some money even as he holds the stock of tata steel  the answer could be a covered call  but  what exactly is a  covered call strategy  a  covered call  is a simple hybrid strategy of selling higher call options  when you buy a call you get a right to buy without the obligation  but  when you sell a call you get the obligation to sell the stock without the right  let us now get back to our illustration on tata steel  paresh had bought tata steel at a price of rs 530  currently  the stock is quoting at lets say rs 502  while it is a notional loss  his funds have been locked up in tata steel for the last six months  that is where a covered call would have helped  in a covered call  the investor holds on to the cash position in tata steel but keeps selling higher strike call options  this is how a covered call strategy will look like when the spot price is rs 502  cash market trade call option trade  buy tata steel  1 061 shares  at rs 530 sell 1 lot 530 strike call at rs 9 50 now there are three possible price outcomes in the above case   if the stock price remains below rs 530  then the entire option premium of rs 9 50 will come into pareshs account and reduce his cost of tata steel to rs 520 50   if the stock price goes sharply lower  then paresh still earns the premium of rs 9 50 but the notional loss on tata steel widens  that is not a comfortable situation   if the stock price goes up to rs 560  then there is a loss on the short call but since he is long on the cash market position  he has nothing much to really worry about  using covered call to consistently reduce your cost of holding the stock  in fact  this is where the real power of a covered call is realised  if the view is that tata steel will not breach above the rs 530 mark then each month paresh can earn the premium by selling the higher call  since the option expires on the last thursday of the month  each month he will have to write a fresh short call  does that mean each month he will make a profit on the call  not exactly  in some months the price movement may not favour and paresh will have to book a loss  let us look at a practical scenario of how this strategy will work over a period of six months where some months are good and some are bad  the table below captures how the covered call would have panned out in the last 6 months  by consistently selling higher calls for six months  paresh would have made rs 17 25 as net profit on selling calls  that effectively reduces his cost of holding tata steel from rs 530 to rs 512 75  at the current market price of rs 502  your mtm loss now looks a lot more justifiable  that is the advantage that you get from a covered call strategy  two very important precautions needed in a covered call  while a covered call is a great strategy to reduce your cost and put your investment to work  there are two important things that you need to keep in mind  a  some traders buy futures on the stock instead of a cash market position  the risk is that if the stock price falls sharply then your call has limited profit but your mtm losses on the futures can mount  b  at no point should this strategy be closed as a single leg  for example  if the price goes up  dont book profits on the cash market position and hold the short call  you are not hedged and your losses can mount rapidly  covered calls are simple to use and easy to understand  in a volatile market like india  these covered calls can be a good bet  at least on predictable stocks with inherent strengths  the author is chief analyst  technical   derivatives   angel broking ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/covered-calls-reduce-cost-holding-stock-4083801.html,492.5,11-06-2019,486.05,TATASTEEL,12:40,here s how to use covered calls to reduce cost of holding a stock,moneycontrol

crore  of which rs 6 500 crore is jlrs  as per the groups own estimate  as jaguar land rover still struggles to tide over a demand slump in china  the worlds biggest auto market  similarly  a steel

companies  tata sons  with its strong balance sheet and liquidity  and being the principal investment holding company of the tata group  is expected to participate in investments in these group companies  said subodh rai  senior director at crisil  as a result  tata sons business risk profile will depend on the success of these investments   tata sons debt to market value of investments

holdings among them   steel has come as a bolt from the blue  tata sons has to also bankroll group initiatives like financial services  aviation  retail  all cash guzzlers  thyssenkrupp was to maximise cost and operational synergies and an alternative could also run into the same regulatory challenges  expect some serious reviews of business and divestments  said an old group watcher on

july 30  2018  the market value of investments was about rs 6 5 lakh crore  of which tcs constituted more than 80  in value  according to crisil  tata sons financial risk profile is supported by companys comfortable liquidity and a sound capital structure    tata sons remains adequately resourced  which together with regular dividend income  primarily from its holding in tcs  provides high cash flow adequacy for debt servicing  which reflects a strong financial profile  as on july 31  2018  tata sons  standalone cash and cash equivalents were about rs 5 587 crore  tata sons will

account for rest  this translates to equivalent amount of indian work force present in the country to handle the projects  however since 2017 the indian overseas workforce began to come down due to visa rejections  according to the data released by the united states citizenship and immigration services  uscis  close to 60 percent of companies that applied for a visa on behalf of foreign workers received requests for additional information in the last quarter of 2018  it was 46 percent in 2017 and 28 percent in 2016  the approval rate fell to 75 percent in the final quarter of 2018 from 83 percent in 2017 and 92 percent in 2016  companies with large number of rejects were indian firms such as  tcs    infosys   and  wipro   apart from new applications  h 1b renewals were a challenge too   earlier  the request for evidence  rfes   which required applicants to submit more documentation  for renewals was rare and they were hardly questioned  it is not the case anymore   said pankai joshi  managing director  nysa global  a firm that specialises in eb 5 migration visas  changing hiring pattern now most of the companies are rejigging their hiring pattern to factor in the visa challenges  yugal joshi  vice president  everest group  a management consultancy firm  said  most of the indian heritage service companies are trying to hire onshore talent as much for visa as for the political climate  a lot of them never used to visit campuses or hire fresh graduates  now they are doing it  this is a significant departure in their talent strategy  v apparao  chief human resources officer at hcl technologies  during the announcement of quarter three results said that the company will continue its localisation efforts that now stand at over 65 percent from single digit over a decade ago    he also said that the company is looking to hire more people overseas in the next fiscal  infosys has made a commitment to hire 10 000 locals by over a two year period in 2017  tcs and wipro too are investing significantly in this space  subcontract hiring second part of the story is increase subcontract hiring  a senior leader in a major it company said that the company is engaging more contract hiring to fill in the talent gap in the us  contract hiring is the most feasible option for companies as a resource talent with a valid visa is mapped to the project based on its requirement  since it is fixed term  the contract ends when the project ends unlike when employees are on bench overseas  incurring unnecessary cost  nisha v is on overseas bench now as her project got over  the company office is 40 miles away from where i stay  there is no point in going to office since there is no work  im waiting for a project to be assigned soon  she said  contract hiring eliminates these issuesthough it comes at a cost  kris lakshmikanth  founder and ceo  head hunters india  an it staffing firm said for most companies the margins have come down by 200 basis points as it majors are spending more on overseas talents  joshi of everest group  said  increased subcontracting costs indicate they aren t hiring or don t plan or are unwilling to hire as much talent as is the demand  this talent management is a key to their business success as they don t want to build bench at onshore location  umesh belludi  co founder  brainhr  a hr consultancy firm based in bengaluru  agrees  belludis firm specialises in processing h 1b for indian it firms and also map them to the right company   but that business has come down by 30 35 percent since the us started imposing visa regulations   he said  with the demand for contract hiring on the rise  his company has moved on to working with valid h 1b visa holders in the us  green card holders and citizens to match them with the right company  a blessing in disguise akhilesh tuteja  global co leader   cyber security at kpmg  agrees that overseas hiring comes at cost and lowers operating margin   but these visa issues might be a blessing in disguise   he added  though the distance does not make client retention a huge issue  according to him proximity to clients does increase the trust factor  salil parekh in his

TCS,the indian it industry generates at least one lakh new jobs a year  but if you thought that makes jobs readily available  the reality is different and that is because the industry  which employs more than 4 million people  has changed the way it hires  basic skills are no longer in demand  and companies want candidates to be job ready from day one  at a time when the sector continues to be on a hiring spree  moneycontrol looks into what has really changed in the way it companies recruit  the five part series will look at each emerging trend with a detailed lens  when venkat raghavan  was in his final year of college  he knew which area he wanted to work  cloud computing  but he was not keen on campus recruitments that gave no guarantee of the profile he wanted  that is when he became aware of hackathons  he attended one of the hackathons  conducted by a top it company and landed a job soon after he graduated  digital  which is disrupting the it sector  is changing the way people are recruited  for instance  campus hiring characterised by written test followed by interview is giving way to hackathons and gaming contests slowly  experts feel hackathons and gaming help enterprises identify talents effectively since the games contest are designed to test a particular talent or skill  this is how a hackathon works  the company organising the contest gives a problem statement to the participants  in a recent hackathon held at a co working space by a technology company  there were 50 participants  in campus recruitments  it could be over 100 depending on the vacancy the company is looking to fill  the winners  runners and sometimes promising finalists  are given offers for internship or even employment depending on whether they are in pre final or final year  since the contests are a test of skill  pay scale differs from traditional hiring  for instance  if a campus hired student gets a package of rs 4 lakh per annum  the gaming contests can up your salary to rs 6 7 lakh per annum  akhilesh tuteja  global co leader   cyber security at kpmg  said that one of the reasons for companies to employ new age technology for hiring is the aspirational value candidates attach to it  he explained that complexity of tests gives the candidate the confidence that he was chosen owing to his abilities  hence it plays a crucial role why he she might choose to work in such companies irrespective of pay package offered  popularity of hackathons hackathons started gaining popularity since 2016 as the it industry went through a wave of digital transformation  companies such as mercer mettl came up with hackathon solutions that have become popular  siddhartha gupta  ceo  mercer mettl  an online assessment platform  said   it is one of the fastest growing product for mercer mettl as companies are not only looking to hire through hackathons but also engage with employees and candidates   gupta explained that companies use hacking contests for campus hiring  engage with future candidates in colleges and also to select candidates in newer areas such as iot and ai  hackathons are also more efficient as there is no duplication of records and are more focused compared to traditional recruitment  while a few companies use third parties such as mercer mettl  it firms such as tcs are investing heavily in gamified hiring platforms over the last seven years  tcs has developed various platforms such as hacking contest  tcs hackquest   coding contest for quality engineering  tcs enquode   programming as a sport  tcs codevita   contest with focus on cloud  automation   artificial intelligence tcs inframind    gamified hiring is a win win for the organisation as well as the students as it marries the organisation opportunities with student aspirations  it has been our observation that the employees coming through the gamified hiring route are high performers and are highly self motivated and their retention rates are also high  krish ganesan  vp   global head  talent acquisition  tcs  told  moneycontrol   time ahead supaul chanda  business head  teamlease digital  an it staffing firm  said while the latest technologies such as cloud  ai and iot are much in demand  majority of the work that is happening in india continues to be traditional outsourcing work including support and maintenance of legacy software  maintenance and support of legacy systems do not necessarily require the knowledge of new age technologies  this means that it firms would need people  who can work on these legacy project that are still the major revenue generators  these hiring  which is in bulk  follow the traditional hiring practice of written tests and interviews  that is precisely why  chanda said   it will be a while before hackathons can replace traditional recruitment methods    names changed to protect identity the market podcast   poor earnings  fii exits drag d street  but silver lining ahead

TCS,indias largest it firm  tcs  was recently in the news for a  trade secret theft  case filed by us based tech firm csc  given that it is not the first such suit againstthe it firm  rather its third after the epic systems case  and the simonelli innovation inc case that was later dismissed by a texascourt  analysts say the incident does raise questions about lackadaisical view indian firms have on intellectual property  ip   lack of guidelines and enforcement for the same  mahindra satyam had also earlier  settled an  ip infringement lawsuit filed by upaid  which offers solutions for payments via mobile phone  for  70 million  the suit was filed by upaid in 2007   indian firms do not take intellectual property concerns seriously  these incidents will force companies to put in stringent guidelines in place and enforce them   saidpareekh jain of technology consulting firm pareekh consulting  jain cautioned that larger implication of such cases will be that companies will be more cautious while outsourcing services and put stringent guidelines for it services firms to follow  at the same time  the incidents may not seriously dent tcs  reputation  what is the lawsuit about  last month  us tech firm csc filed a lawsuit in the us court accusing tcs of improperly accessing its proprietary code to build an insurance platform for the us market  a week later  tcs responded to the allegation in the court stating that lawsuit of csc lacks evidence and it is aimed at disrupting its  2 billion business deal with transamerica  the case is similar to the two others filed against tcs by epic systems and simonelli innovation inc  let us take epic systems case where tcs has levied a penalty of  420 million  the us based healthcare software company epic systems had implemented its healthcare management system in the kaiser permanente  kp  healthcare service provider  tcs was hired to test the system implementation  epic systems had restricted tcs accessto consultants  which limits tcs access to epic s documents  despite that  epic systems alleged that tcs employees used a kp employee s credentials to steal over 6 000 documents that contain epic system s development information  deepak shenoy in his  post  said the case was exposed when a whistleblower inside tcs warned kp and epic about the issue  in 2014  the company filed a lawsuit against tcs for stealing its intellectual property to develop its own product   the company did not misuse or derive any benefit from epic s documents and plans to defend its position vigorously before the trial judge as well as in appeal   tcs said in the filing as quoted by  the economic times   the us court in 2016 penalised tcs for  940 million  this was later brought down to  420 million to comply with an existing legal limit on punitive damages  tcs is fighting the case in a federal court  the simonelli case after the epic case  tcs faced another lawsuit from simonelli innovation inc that alleged the it major for wrongful and improper use of simonelli s intellectual property  ip  and trade secrets to build its own consulting practice  a  mint  article  quoting the lawsuit filed by simonelli on august 15  2018 said   this case is being brought because tcs and taic  tata america international corp   agreed to keep the ip and trade secrets of simonelli innovation confidential and to only use same in projects under the  alliance agreement  that would mutually benefit both entities   despite this  the defendants  tcs  took the methodology and foundation given to them by plaintiff  simonelli   and used it to transform their consulting options  obtain customers and increase revenue without including the plaintiff as required by the alliance agreement contract between the parties   the article said  however  in response to an email query from moneycontrol  simonelli said   plaintiff and defendants have resolved all claims in this lawsuit and  pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure 41 a  1  a  ii   plaintiff stipulates that plaintiffs claims against defendants should be dismissed with prejudice  with each party responsible for its own costs and fees   analysts said these incidents are unlikely to affect the reputation of tcs from a business point of view   the tcs brand has taken a little hit in the developer community  but from business point of view  most understand that litigation is a separate area and might not cause an impact   said jain of pareekh consulting  according to jain  with it firms now getting into the development of products and platforms  there needs to be  chinese wall  between products and services  yugal joshi  vice president  everest group  a consulting firm  agrees that ip charges are not uncommon however  joshipointed out that most service providers do deliver platform based services and therefore need to further enhance their governance mechanism  in addition  they need to further educate their workforce on enforcing such a mechanism   also  service providers should not buckle under the pressure of growth  many employees may end up taking unintended and non malicious short cuts and find themselves violating the ip ownership   he added

TCS,tech mahindra   the country s fifth largest it company by market capitalisation  is set to buy back from shareholders up to 2 05 crore shares worth rs 1 956 crore at a price of rs 950 apiece  its peers  tcs    infosys  and  hcl technologies also completed their buybacks earlier  generally  the cash rich company buy back shares to support price as well as to distribute cash among shareholders  it is also seen that when the stock price falls sharply despite strong fundamentals  the company uses share buyback to increase trust among shareholders  a share buyback is a corporate action wherein a company takes back shares from its shareholders at a price higher than the market price  in doing so  the number of outstanding shares in the market reduce  this allows companies to invest in themselves  soshouldshareholders tender shares in the buyback  moneycontrol spoke to several analysts about what investors should do and they are mixed in their opinion for short term  experts are though confident that one should hold the stock for long term   minority shareholders  especially retail shareholders  should participate in the buyback and hold on to rest of the shares for long term   sameer kalra  founder   president  research   target investing said  this buyback is more like a replacement of dividend in more tax efficient manner and the amount announced is 2 7 percent of market cap which is more like a dividend yield  he added   if investors do not participate they forego the outgo   vineeta sharma  head of research  narnolia financial advisors also said investor with a short term  one year horizon may tender shares for the buyback  while those having a long term horizon may continue holding the stock  assuming 10 percent of shareholders in retail segment tender shares in the buyback  the acceptance ratio is expected at 45 percent  according tosharma  who said at cmp of rs 825  this generates an expected tax adjusted return of 6 1 percent assuming post buyback price to be rs 841  valuing 17x fy20e eps  aum capital also advised participating in the share buyback  on the other hand  shubham kakrania  research analyst at stewart   mackertich wealth management said one should hold the investment for the long term since the buyback size is small and he believes the strong growth visibility in the telecom vertical on the back of large deal wins in last few quarters fares well for tech mahindra in the longer term  he believes with the pressure on telecom industry waning  and enterprise business showing good momentum on the back of manufacturing and public services  the growth trajectory looks much stronger for tech mahindra  astha jain  senior research analyst at hem securities also agreed with shubham saying as the acceptance ratio is around 5 15 percent  one should be better to hold the stock for long term rather than tendering shares in buyback  she expects the stock to surpass rs 1 000 levels in next one year  meanwhile  the outlook on the stock as well as entire sector is positive  experts said  here are their comments  shubham kakrania we have a buy rating on tech mahindra with a target price of rs 954 per share and it is one of our top pick among it stocks  central to our investment rational is our view that tech mahindra is nicely putting in place the building blocks to win big in 5g  the industry expects 5g spending by the carriers to pick up in cy19  with the company getting its fair share of the network services piece from fy21 onwards  this holds the potential to drive double digit growth in telecom revenues  further  enterprise is likely to maintain good growth aided by higher digital revenue and strong total contract value  margin can improve modestly from here  given the scope in profitability improvement among subsidiaries  sameer kalra we have buy rating on the company and it is one of top recommended it stocks post infosys   tcs  tech mahindra has won big deals in past one year which have started showing into the revenue line and telecommunication segment which is biggest contributor to the revenue and margins is showing reversal since last two quarters  there has been improvement

continued deal wins   440 million win during the current quarter  and improvement in the enterprise segment  5g is expected to roll out late in fy20 should provide impetus to growth  margins are

TCS,calendar year 2018was quite strong for technology companies  which reflected in stock prices as well  thanks to strong it spending by clients  and rupee depreciation  these stocks rallied in the range of 12 39 percent in last one year with biggies like tcs    infosys    wipro  and  tech mahindra  climbing the maximum 32 39 percent  however  correction seen in these stocks in december quarter was largely due to overvaluation  rupee appreciation and weak market conditions   the december 2018 quarter was strong courtesy a solid it spending environment and was powered by execution of deal wins of the earlier quarters  consistent with expectations  total contract value  tcv  and deal pipeline are strong   kotak institutional equities said  increased onsite cost structure was visible

infotech   surpassed expectations on all parameters   performance on margins was a mixed bag with decline reported by tcs and infosys and increase by wipro and tech mahindra  the pressure point on profitability is resulting largely from shortage of talent in the us combined with challenges on procurement of fresh visas and even renewals of existing ones   kotak said  the research house expects the headwind  increase in reliance on subcontractors in the us to fulfill demand  inflating costs in the process  to continue in fy20  analysts largely expect steady growth in the fourth quarter as well  but after strong exit from fy19  fy20 is not expected to be strong one due to challenges of likely slowdown in the us  and china us trade war concerns  in addition  movement in usd rupee rate is the biggest risk   fy20 growth will be a function of two factors   1  external headwinds emanating from slowdown in the us  uncertainty around brexit and trade wars  and  2  tailwind from increasing digital deal sizes and accelerated deal momentum courtesy clarity on simplification of the core   kotak said  admittedly a strong exit to fy19  bulging order book and positive commentary on demand should translate into a far better fy20  but the downside of a slowing market and the margin implications of the same cannot be ignored either  it added  all said  the research house expects fy20 growth to be broadly in line or marginally lower than fy19   within this  certain companies will report higher growth and some other lower in fy20e over fy19   niharika ojha  analyst at narnolia financial advisors also believes demand looks robust but the industry is grappling with supply side constraints to cater to the demand   in order to meet the skill to aggressively capture the demand  companies are moving towards subcontracting to fulfill their needs resulting in margin contraction due to higher cost involved  also  companies are making investments into training employees and adding workforce  infosys  which captured the early sign of these challenges  should be the first to start bearing fruits of its early investment   she said  according to her  attrition remains a key concern as the shortage of talent is giving the skilled employees a higher advantage across the market  experts largely feel majority of positives seem to have been priced in but there are stocks

evening to all of you and a very happynew year  we are wrapping up 2018 with a strong revenue growth  in fact strongest revenue growth in 14 quarters on a constant currency basis  our q3revenue grew 12 1  yoy on constant currency terms  9 7  in dollar terms and20 8  in rupee  we saw growth accelerate in all key verticals and across allour geographies  our operating margin for the quarter was 25 6  comparedto 25 2  for the same period last year  and our net margin for the quarter wasat 21 7   an improvement of 57 basis points over the same period last year  information and later on i will step in again to talk about a few broad demandtrends before we open it up for questions  over to you  ramki  v ramakrishnan   thank you  rajesh  first  let me walk through the headline numbers  in thethird quarter of fy2019  our revenues grew 1 8  qoq and 12 1  yoy on aconstant currency basis  reported revenue in inr was 373 4 billion which isyoy growth of 20 8   in usd terms  revenue was  5 25 billion which is yoygrowth of 9 7   coming to the segments  let me go over how the various segments performedduring the quarter  as a reminder  all the growth numbers are yoy and inconstant currency terms  we continue to see good recovery in our banking financial services and insurance vertical  our bfsi business acceleratedfurther this quarter  growing 8 6  compared to 6 1  in the prior quarter growth was led by energy and utilities which grew 18 1   life sciences andhealthcare at 15 7   communications and media which grew 10 8  and theretail cluster grew at 10 5   revenue from digital engagements made up30 1  of our revenue  growth of 52 7 yoy  and india and latin america grew 9 7  and 7 6  respectively  coming to products and platforms  they continue to do well  let me first talkabout ignio  our cognitive automation software  two very important markettrends are driving strong demand for ignio  first  customers are increasinglytaking a machine first approach to operations  and moving from pointdeployments to enterprise wide adoption of automation  secondly  customersare moving away from robotic automation to intelligent automation  havingestablished a very strong client base and references within the first three yearsof its launch  ignio is very well placed to capitalize on these trends  we had10 new wins in q3  spread across north america  uk and europe  in addition  digitate won several pilot programs  that should hopefully result inlarger engagements in the future  tcs bancs  our flagship product suite in the financial services domain had 5new wins and 5 go lives during the quarter  our advanced drug development platform had two wins in q3  of adverse events or pharmacovigilance  in the regulatory space  worlds largest recruitment exam on behalf of the railway recruitment boardin india  assessing over 18 million candidates  they had several new customerssigning up  most importantly  the deal sizes are going up and some of the largeion deals are huge even by global standards  one of the contracts signed byion recently had tcv of over  0 5 billion  our customer centric model has meant that we stay very focused and findingnewer and newer opportunities to add value to our customers by looking at ourcustomers business in a holistic way  our full stakeholder services strategyand our deep contextual knowledge of our customers businesses has allowedus to deepen our relationships and gain share  those of you who follow ourclient metrics know that quarter after quarter  year after year  there is a steadymigration of customers up the revenue buckets  at the end of q3  we had 45 clients in the  100 million  revenue band  8 morethan what we had last year same time  likewise over the last year  we haveadded 5 clients in the  50 million  bracket  bringing the total to 99  8 clients inthe  20 million  bracket  bringing the total to 211  and 55 clients in the  1million  band  taking up the total to 996  let me now cover the financials briefly  despite the currency volatility duringthe quarter and slight increases in the cost of doing business in the majormarkets  our operating margin has been very resilient at 25 6  which is up0 4  yoy  aided by a higher other income  our net income margin remained expanded by0 6  yoy to 21 7   the effective tax rate for the quarter was 24 2   accountsreceivable was at 70 dso in dollar terms  the net cash flow from operationswas 86 8 billion which is 23 3  of our revenue and 107  of our net income free cash flow was 81 5 billion and invested funds as at 31st december stoodat 438 billion  the board has recommended an interim dividend of 4 per share  organization  the proportion of women in the workforce rose further to 35 8 in q3  likewise the number of nationalities represented workforce has gone upfurther to 151  million learning hours on our digital learning platform in q3  as of december31st  we have trained over 292 000 employees on digital technology and over318 000 employees on agile methods  these ongoing investments in organictalent development  our empowering and energizing workplace andprogressive hr policies have resulted in industry leading talent retention ratesat tcs  our last twelve months attrition in it services was 11 2  in q3  trends  rajesh gopinathan   thank you  ramki  driven by increased spending by banks on areas like next generation customerexperience using micro segmentation  rearchitecture of data for deliveringinsights and the adoption for micro services for greater business agility  transformation driven by top line concerns  and the need to participate acrossmultiple segments  every enterprise is reimagining multiple aspects of itsbusiness  some of them more profoundly than others  and looking to leveragetechnology to differentiate itself in a business 4 0 world  it is not very hard tosee why they are doing it  technology based challengers are disruptingmultiple industries and causing upheavals  retail is a sector which has beenin the throes of this for some period of time  we have seen that impact on manylong established retail brands whose businesses have eroded and some ofthem have faced financial stress or even liquidation  our approach to industries going through such turbulence is to participate veryaggressively in our customers growth and transformation agenda whileremaining vigilant  however  we do have the risk that if something unexpectedcomes around  like i said   any such stress  we would take some impact fromsuch events  but we believe that the larger opportunity is worth that risk  more importantly  if you look at the strategic responses from the incumbents there has been a massive ramp up in their technology investment  they havebeen steadily investing in building up online channels  integrating them withthe physical store and the more ambitious ones are looking at how to tweaktheir business models to leverage their phygital presence to build moatsaround their businesses and differentiate themselves from pure ecommerceplayers  initiatives and putting in place operating models and digital architectures thatwill help them accomplish the goal  we have pratik here  and for those of youwho would like to understand this further  pratik would be happy to get intomore details  the important thing is that whether it is retail  bfsi or any of the other industry our participation in the growth and transformation initiatives did not happen byaccident or in a day or suddenly  it has been the outcome of a long process ofevolution that we have gone through  and it has been enabled by the customercentricorganization structure that we adopted in 2008 and which we have beendoubling down over the course of the last year  significant investments have gone into building the necessary capabilities  wehave been systematically investing in our research and innovation programand integrating the cto function closer and closer with our overall businessoperations  themes across various industry verticals and come up with innovative solutionsthat we have been showcasing to customers at our innovation centers andcustomizing them to meet their specific needs  in many of these cases  theoutcomes are various forms of intellectual property  some of them which aregetting productized and others which are getting integrated into a solution asaccelerators and frameworks  but all of which help customers reduce risk aswell as time to market  so  our service portfolio  enhanced by our r icapabilities and our ip portfolio  are an integral part of a complex servicedelivery and service architecture that we are putting in place and allowing usto participate in a very differentiated way in our customers growth andtransformation agenda  the other element of it is that while the r i agenda and integration of the ctoside is happening  in many cases the most impactful innovation does notnecessarily come from the formal structure  it comes from within tcs teamsworking with customers at their location  these teams often possess very deepcontextual knowledge of the customers business that we have been talkingabout multiple times in the last year or two  and which is often unparalleledeven within the customers own organization given the continuity and thelongevity of many of our relationships  it is the incremental little innovationsthat come up on a daily basis in a collaborative  agile workspace  rather thanone big idea  that ultimately creates value for customers and ensure that ourability to stay relevant to the customers continuously increases  this flowsthrough into the metrics that you see in our client portfolio and the steadymining that we are able to achieve here  then there are our alliance partnerships  in addition to close relationships withvirtually all the major technology providers  we have been systematicallyinvesting into our co innovation network  coin  where we partner withstart ups with promising new technologies that we jointly take to market orembed into the solutions that we build  partners and customers  we are partnering red hat to build verticalized cloudnative solutions  we have launched a solution for using drones for testing ofrailway assets and their maintenance in partnership with sap  similarly  wehave partnered with a customer  singapore airlines  to launch a jointlydeveloped solution that transforms airlines ground operations using digitaltechnologies  we have also recently partnered with honeywell and they werespeaking about it in the aerospace marketplace that has been built  so  thereare multiple instances where we are becoming very strategic partners in thisdigital business transformation that many of our clients are going through  knowledge  our portfolio of intellectual property and our business 4 0 thoughtleadership framework are critical differentiators which have helped us gainsignificant market share as well as mind share  to further strengthen ourpositioning in this expanding opportunity  we have launched a new sub brandcalled tcs pace in the december quarter  which embodies all thesedifferentiated capabilities  showcases  co innovation network  start up accelerators  tcs think spaces academic research spaces  agile workspaces  etc   which are all designedto ignite collaborative experimentation  research and rapid product prototypingalongside customers  partners and academia  are seeing is on account of our ability to participate in our customers growthand transformation initiatives  it shows up not just as industry leading growthand digital services and strong overall revenue growth in the quarter gone by but also in our deals and in the pipeline  we had very strong deal closure this quarter  giving us the biggest order bookyear till date in fy19  the total value of contracts signed in q3 was us 5 9billion  importantly  the order book has expanded in every segment  whetheryou look at north america or bfsi or retail  our deal pipeline is also lookingquite strong  giving us an excellent start into the new year  with that i want to open up the line for questions  moderator   thank you very much  sir  ladies and gentlemen  we will now begin thequestion and answer session  we will take the first question from the line ofdiviya nagarajan from ubs  please go ahead  diviya nagarajan   a couple of questions here  could you guys just give us a sense of how yousee demand trending in the current environment  there are growing macroconcerns  how do you reconcile this with the strong contract momentum thatyou are seeing right now  the second is on i am trying to understand whymargins went down  normally this is a quarter for margin improvement and thenet currency impact is still being positive or at least flat  so  could you just runus through what were the additional costs of doing business that you are talkingabout in the basis points impact on the margins  rajesh gopinathan   sure  diviya  we are participating in the demand that we are seeing  and as isaid  our order closure for this quarter has been almost a billion dollars morethan the order closure for the immediately prior quarter  and it is not just orderclosure  our pipeline itself has expanded  and it has expanded acrosssegments  both geographical and industry segment  this is the reality that wesee  macro and its timeframe  our approach is that that is not a factor that we cancontrol  so  we will participate aggressively in the demand that we see  we areinvesting to participate and anticipate the pipeline that we have  and prettymuch that is the element that you see reflected in our margin picture also  when the demand came about  our intent is to always participate as much aspossible  and towards that  the immediate response to it has been to hire intothe subcontractor pool  which is the flex pool that is available  if you look atthe cor   sg a breakup  you will find that that line item has expanded byabout 60 basis points  additions  in aggregate  we have now hired 27 000 people in the last one yearon a net basis  this compares to a net addition of about 7 000 last year  so we are investing in our own people  we are investing in the flex capacity  andwe are investing in making sure that we capture the demand that we see  whilekeeping an eye out on the overall market  but we see strong momentum andwe are going to back the sales team in making sure that we capture it  diviya nagarajan   just a follow up on that  do you expect the subcontracting cost to continueremain elevated given the supply conditions  secondly  also talk about someweakness in banking  could you just kind of throw some light on that  rajesh gopinathan   on subcontracting  there are two elements to it  the short term impact of it isas you see demand spiking  we will acquire and period to period there will besome volatility in it  subcontracting is typically a costlier option than obviouslya more optimized employee pool  both from an operations perspective as wellas from a cost structure perspective  but we are quite confident that we will beable to rationalize that over a period of time  once we have visibility and we areable to plan for it in a slightly better horizon  so  i am not too worried about thespiking on that  anybody else  in fact  if anything we are better situated than most participantsin that market  whether it be competitors or customers to actually have a betterstructure and that should result in multiple elements in the market  whether itbe pricing or cost rationalizing over time  so  to your question  its difficult to say  but we are not wedded to any artificialmargin  we will participate aggressively in demand and we will optimize  wedo not see a structural challenge to our overall margin perspective  and that isthe medium term view  negative for us  so  we grew 1 8  on constant currency but in rupee terms thegrowth is about 1 3   so  the currency impact  both on the revenue line as wellas on the margin line has been a net contraction  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of sandip agarwal fromedelweiss  please go ahead  sandip agarwal   rajesh  i have two questions  one  on the digital side  we once again saw verystrong growth on the digital side and in the initial comments what i hear is thatthe sizes are also going up  so can you throw some more light on that side what is exactly happening on the space  are the existing clients increasingtheir budgets or increasing the size or more budgets are getting reallocatedfrom marketing or the situation is like we are getting more revenues or highergrowth because of new clients coming in  question  2  on the retail industry how you are seeing the digital playing out because sometime back we wereseeing some weakness in the industry that because of the brick and mortarmodel not spending aggressively but what is the sense there now  rajesh gopinathan   sandeep  i will ask ngs to address your first question and then pratik cancome in on the retail specific view of it  ng subramaniam   yes  sandeep  overall the demand for digital has been at  i would say is veryhigh for us  and every single offering that we have carved out under theleadership of krishnan has received enormous traction in the marketplace  specifically during the quarter  i think iot  intelligent automation  artificialintelligence based automation  and blockchain  these are areas where wehave seen lot of new deals  and these are fairly secular in terms of bothverticals  as well as across existing customers and new customers  there arenew customers who have just signed up with us  specifically for automatingtheir operations and then bringing in intelligent automation into their operations so  it is fairly secular  the demand pipeline for intelligence automation itselfthe whole set of offerings that we have come up with under the machine firstapproach  with the machine first delivery model  has received very goodtraction  i should say  pratik pal   hi  this is pratik here  retailers continue to invest significantly in what you callthe online offline retail  or what we call interconnected retail  the only thing isthat the nature of investment in this interconnected retail is moving from thefront end to the back end  more in the supply chain which is a much larger andbigger investment  we are participating very heavily in some of these largetransformations that are going on around the supply chain for enabling theinterconnected retail  online offline or omni channel retail have actually gone up significantly higher the highest in the last six years  this is a very good testimony that the offlineretailers which has a very strong online presence are doing extremely well andare probably taking market share out from the online only retailers  the goodthing is that we participate with lot of these large retailers who have thisonline offline presence  hence  while there are one or two blips here and there and that will continue  we do see good demand going forward  thank you  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of sandeep shah fromcgs cimb  please go ahead  sandeep shah   just the question first in terms of margins  so  if i look at the first nine monthsthe average rupee dollar is close to around  69 9 to  70 while the margin onthe first nine months is close to 25 7   but in the television interview  we stillsaid that we have a comfort range of 26 to 28   at the same time we want toparticipate aggressively in terms of the demand which is increasing throughdigital  so  what gives you confidence to still say that ebit margin could be inthe range of 26   28  despite rupee dollar being almost  70 versus what itused to be earlier your range was based on close to 65  66  rajesh gopinathan   sandeep  you are making multiple assumptions  so let us address it  ourmargin is a structural margin band which is actually based on where we expectcurrency scenario to be  not pegged to some artificial static currency  it isimportant that you understand the business model  the business model isbased on delivering from high inflation location and selling into low inflationlocation  our prices are indexed to inflation in developed markets whichtypically are in the low single digits  our costs are indexed to inflation in anemerging market  which is typically in the high single digit or even double digitareas  this differential will get reflected over time in a currency depreciation and that is an economic fact that our business model is strongly built upon  so the expectation of steady margin assumes a steady economic model but thesemarkets are lumpy and they are sticky  so  typically they will correctthemselves over a period of time  as long as we take long enough view  weshould be able to achieve that  our commentary is that we see structural stability in our business model and ifthat business models structural stability is not impacted  it can get impactedtypically only by competitive pressure coming either from a customer side orfrom another competitor side or replacement side  replacement side whichhad been spoken about can we participate in digital  will we getdisintermediated by automation  i think we have more than established thatwe are actually on top of those curves  in overall relative competitivenessterms  i think if anything we are stronger today than what we were in the past so  that is where the confidence about being able to maintain stable marginbands is coming from  rather than one off commentary about some impact thatwe see or some changes that we see in the market  sandeep shah   i think fair enough  just a follow up to this  rajesh  in the client negotiation areyou able to actually pass on this message where you are in a position to sayfor a client to compensate for a high inflation cost in terms of delivery versusdelivery to location where there is low inflation  rajesh gopinathan   absolutely  many customers contracts build in  either explicitly or implicitly cost of living adjustment factors  it is a pricing call as to how that appears does it appear as a separate line item  or does it appear as an integratedpricing  but more importantly  it is integral to our business model and ourdecision making process  quite frankly  it is well understood by most of ourmature clients and in the markets that we operate in  and that is where you seethis resilience over a period of time  sandeep shah   in terms of revenue side  i think this year we are being doing extremely goodin terms of yoy growth trajectory  but if we assume there are no major macroshocks  do you believe that the demand momentum can help us in terms ofachieving a double digit over a period of time in terms of next two  three yearsrather than just cy18 or fy2019 i am not asking for a guidance  but is itlike your confidence levels are higher looking at the demand momentum  rajesh gopinathan   we had set ourselves an explicit target to get back to a double digit growthtrajectory which  we are happy to say  we have achieved and we are quiteconfident that we will end the year fy19 with double digit growth  beyond that i do not want to comment about future  we are giving you early visibility ondata as we see it  that is why we are sharing with you what our deal closuresare  we are sharing with you commentary on what we see as the pipeline beyond that  i would not want to be drawn into a comment  sandeep shah   just a follow up  in terms of this time looking at the macro risk as a whole  atthe same time most of the large deal awards are coming through are integrationof the back end with the front end which is largely digital  is it fair to say if macroshock not bigger  the correlation of macro risk to the it spend maybe lowerversus what it used to be earlier  do you believe the digital demand is morediscretionary or do you believe no  the macro shock will lead to slow down indigital demand  rajesh gopinathan   our experience has been that in practical terms  when the bottom falls off amarket  customers will cut what they can cut fastest  not necessarily what theyshould cut or what they would like to cut  so  after some time rational coststructure changes happen  which is more rational and more sophisticated  ido not think this will change depending on the technology cycle per se  if asudden downturn happens  everything will be cut  whoever can be cut first willbe cut  it does not matter whether that was the worst thing to cut  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of sudheer guntupallifrom ambit capital  please go ahead  sudheer guntupalli   you have indicated that the deal closure in this quarter was around  5 9 billionwhich was almost 20  increase over the previous quarter  in fact  in both juneand september quarters  this remain flattish at around  4 9 billion  just wantto check if there is any positive booster coming in here because of the budgetflush reasons in us organizations given typically december is the fiscal closefor most of them  if at all there is any such impact because of these budgetflush reasons  will it be possible to give the quantitative or qualitative color onthat  rajesh gopinathan   typically  budget flush will happen in actual spend  rather than contractclosure  i would not think that that is there  but we have essentially shared withyou this data and we have told you that we are sharing it on an as is where isbasis  we will start commenting about trends and year on year changes as webuild this over a period of time  and we understand it better and you understandit better  sudheer guntupalli   within bfsi and communications  can you highlight which are the subsegmentswhich have driven growth acceleration in this quarter  and evenotherwise which are the sub segments which are doing well in these twoverticals  rajesh gopinathan   if you take banking per se  the north american market is better than europeand uk  in insurance  it is kind of the other way round  overall insurance isgood  but we have seen good strength in europe and uk insurance  on theservices side of it  ngs has commented earlier on the various technologiesand micro services architecture etc  where the demand is coming from in bfsi  quarter last quarter  it swung back up  but it is still too complicated to give youa very trend line based theme  5g is one big component of the spend that willcome  but even that one will take time and it will get manifested not necessarilyin cmi alone  but across multiple industries  so  we are well positioned toparticipate  whether it be 5g  whether it be fiber rollout  whether it be thevirtualization of various business models inside the cmi space  but the sectoris likely to remain volatile in the foreseeable future  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of shashi bhushanfrom axis capital  please go ahead  shashi bhushan   our large deal flow has been very strong over the last few quarters now  almostsix quarters  a few questions related to that  what are some of the keycompetencies that tcs would have built over the years to win these largedeals  rajesh gopinathan   we have spoken about this that we probably have the most balanced andintegrated service portfolio in the industry  and we have invested significantlyto stitch it together to be able to deliver integration solutions to our customers  that is the biggest differentiator and earlier on as i mentioned  the combinationof service portfolio that has been constantly invested on to keep it relevant andclose integration with both domain assets  intellectual property assets  ourproduct portfolio and very close working with alliance partners and anecosystem  that is allowing us to participate in complex deal structures  shashi bhushan   a couple of questions on the execution side  what are the risks that these largedeals possess both in terms of revenue and margin over the tenure and anyinitiatives to mitigate those  n g  subramaniam   i think success in our entire business lies in execution  over a period of time we have built very strong methodologies  delivery governance and systematicway of risk mitigation  let me put it this way  so  the way the deals arestructured  the projects are structured  the execution milestones are structured is done very collaboratively with our clients  then based on our own knowledgebase of what does it take to deliver some of these engagements  and howbusiness value can be realized both for our clients and for ourselves in asystematic and periodic manner  so  the overall value proposition  the tools technologies  the solution accelerators  and the quality management systems all of that play a role in structuring these large engagements  some of them will be cost heavy in the beginning but how quickly we can moveinto a situation where we will be able to draw down depends on how quicklywe are able to deliver some of the early milestones  any of these large projects one of my own personal experience is that if you do not miss the first threemilestones  then the rest of the things will work like a clock  governance that we put in place  and the right level of connects with the rightoperating  as well as management leadership at the customer side  all theseare critical success factors  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of rahul jain fromemkay global  please go ahead  rahul jain   my first question is on these four segments that we said on digital  iot  ai andintelligent automation  some of the larger peers have been working on apartnership model where they have partnered leaders like amazon  googleand microsoft to put them on their cutting edge side in these technologies  so are we working on such kinds of alliances to take our edge on this competitivestrength furthermore  rajesh gopinathan   absolutely  as we have mentioned early in the opening comments also  ourabilities set is built on a combination of investment into our own assets as wellas very strong collaboration with partners across the full spectrum  both thelarger technology partners as well as emerging technology partners in thecoin network  so  we are absolutely trying to maximize the leverage of theecosystem across the full spectrum  rahul jain   in terms of the competitive landscape  if you can define some of thedifferentiation that you already highlighted  so how it has changed  is itbecoming less competitive game within the client and deal size which you arechasing or it is still intensified and just that our deal win ratios improved versusin the past  rajesh gopinathan   competitive intensity has not necessarily reduced  but definitely the field is amuch sparser one in many of these newer areas  rahul jain   because if we see from an absolute addition perspective what we have beenadding versus what is the total net addition by the indian it export  from thatperspective it is definitely rising from a market share perspective and even froman incremental global it spend perspective  the incremental market share isgetting significant  so  how this can sustain and what can drive this incrementalmarket share this is to for a much longer period  rajesh gopinathan   that is the essence of what we have been talking about  that it is a fairlydifferentiated offerings and complex offerings which are not easily replicated as long as we remain vigilant and relevant to our customers  i think we shouldbe able to participate incrementally more and more in their spends  rahul jain   lastly on the bfsi  do the significant earning uptick for these players in cy18can influence the prospect for our clients in the subsequent cy19 or it is notany function of that materially  rajesh gopinathan   our hope is of course that they will spend some money on us but actually thefinancials look good for all of them  balance sheets have never been healthier so there is a technology imperative  there is a capacity to spend  and hopefullythat will translate into even more spend next year  rahul jain   so  that would also go towards the core modernization kind of a space or thiswould be more on the run side of it  rajesh gopinathan   definitely  the capital spend on core modernization should continue  there issignificant amount of pent up demand  as i said  technology imperative is alsoquite high  so  we are now well and truly into a technology refresh  and it alldepends on what the appetite for it is  the demand is definitely there  moderator   thank you  we will take the next question from the line of vibhor singhal fromphillipcapital  please go ahead  vibhor singhal   sir  just two questions primarily on the growth front  so  i think it has beenconsecutively seven or eight quarters that we have done extremely well in theeuropean geography  much ahead of growth in the us geography  so  just tobasically on the cautious side  any headwinds do you see from this growth thatwe are reporting in the european geography that you might want to be cautiousabout  otherwise you see this continuing growth in the next few quarters aswell  secondly  on the overall growth front  right now if we look at our size  itis around more than  5 billion quarterly  around  20 billion we are bigger thanaccenture in terms of our outsourcing business at this point of time  keepingthe other macro headwinds and other things aside  do you at some point oftime feel that size is probably becoming an impediment for us in terms ofgrowing in let us say double digit this year of course  we manage to do it andthat is a real commendable task but going forward do you see the sizebecoming an impediment in terms of we being able to achieve an industryleading growth or a double digit growth per se  rajesh gopinathan   both your questions are difficult to answer  so let me answer the europe partof it  there is nothing that we currently see that would show weaknessappearing in europe  obviously  there are few sectors  few elements whereweakness keeps coming in and out but overall i think if anything the europeanenvironment has changed for the positive over the last two years rather thanmove to negative  again  all of it keeping aside any major macro headwind sayfor country problems  etc  so  europe  structurally we do not see anything thatis currently on the horizon in our business per se  outside of whatever you arehearing on the macro side  incrementally any new ways to answer it  but let me put it this way  if ever weget to a point where size is the only reason we are not growing  we can verywell split ourselves into two companies of equal size  and then continuegrowing  it is not a basis  n g  subramaniam   the other point which i can add is that in europe specifically  we see a thinkingof customers wanting to share platforms  wanting to create ecosystems  i thinkour business 4 0 thought leadership framework enables such a thinking andwe are increasingly looking at such opportunities where we will be able tocreate ecosystems along with our customers by rolling out solutions usingtechnologies such as blockchain  i think this is one area where we see someemergence  we see some thinking that is developing  specifically  in terms ofsharing some of the technology platforms on the newer technologies  vibhor singhal   if i can just extend that question to just one small more thing that i wanted toask  as rajesh said  that last two years we have seen tremendous growthmomentum and structural changes in europe which are all positive in thedirection  is it also a thing that till now let us say of course we had othergeographies growing but  uk was of course always a large part of ourbusiness  almost 50  of the overall revenue that is coming from europe andnow as we basically expand our business to continental europe whereprobably english is not the primary language  we have already been growingin those geographies  but does that mean that the growth will probably comeat a little bit of higher cost in terms of we needing to hire more local guys withmore local languages and cultural thing and that could be let us say suchmaybe a bit of dampener in terms of margins from this geography  n g  subramaniam   all the things that you said are factors that we should consider while formulatingthe solution  formulating the strategy  we have been operating in continentaleurope across multiple language speaking countries for over two  threedecades now  we have a very calibrated model in terms of how do youformulate the solutions  how do you formulate delivery locations for suchsolutions and which are the business models that we should practice  all of it we are now confident that the growth as it emerges across continentaleurope  whether it is nordics  whether it is central europe or uk or in theeastern europe  i think the different models can be applied  we are very wellgeared for capturing some of these  moderator   thank you  the next question is from the line of viju george from j p  morgan please go ahead  viju george   i had a question on cost of delivery  in this call you alluded to cost risingincluding subcontractor cost  that is probably going to be felt at a sector widelevel and i am sure it is not going to be restricted to tcs  do you think that itmay be possible for us as an industry to maybe pass this on as higher pricingto clients maybe with bit of a lag  rajesh gopinathan   viju  as i said earlier  the market is becoming significantly supply constraintand we are in no way worse off than anybody else  in fact  we have a fairamount of margin head room to absorb it  whereas that is not the case for manyothers  so  this will start translating into the pricing side of it  there were someassumptions that there will be significant insourcing and all of service providerswill be impacted by client preferring to take things in house  increasingly  among clients there is a greater realization that that is not an easytask to execute on  and if they try to execute on it  they are also participatingin the same market with a much lesser capability to actually build the talentpool required for it  so  rational decision making will prevail and some amountof market forces will come into play  but as you rightly mentioned typicallythese things take time  there is a lag impact to it  so  we are very focused on one thing  we will capture demand and we will beton our ability to be executing better than others  and our ability to rationalizethese cost structures over a medium to long term period  viju george   one other question i had  i think you have addressed this partly  but if we lookat the development spend that we see around ourselves today  it is very digitalcentricversus may be four or five years back where it might have been a littlebit more ambitious if i may put it that way  may be growth looking out for fourto five years hence  today digital one says it is little bit more less discretionary it is intended to create a sustain competitive advantage for the lagger  thisintent to catch up  so does that make the nature of developmental spends lessimmune or relatively less immune to some global macro disturbancescompared to may be four or five years back  i am just trying to understandwhether this has become a strategic area for clients that they will not pull backat a hint of may be a little bit of a macro issue  not a shock  rajesh gopinathan   viju  this abstraction at an industry level  you guys are much better than us todo it  but let me share with you one industry and what we see  and which kindof corroborates your line of thinking  if you look at retail  and if you look at thatindustry in terms of the structural strength that it has had  even in the throes offinancial distress  most retailers have only doubled down and significantlyincreased their technology spend especially on the digital transformationagenda areas that pratik referred to omnichannel  multichannel  integration etc   so  that is a great example in a very very stressed environment that thisis not discretionary spend  this is not something that somebody is doingbecause they think that they are investing for the future  so  that is when youlook at it in one extreme you can see that play out  now different industries in different parts of the cycle  how will decision makingbe across industries and across individual companies and industry  thatabstraction i think you guys have better access to data to think that through but retail is a great example of the reality of what we just spoke about  moderator   thank you  next question is from the line of apurva prasad from hdfcsecurities  please go ahead  apurva prasad   just a couple of things i want to query  you mentioned on the insourcingcaptive side  is it fair to assume that the challenge especially on the bfs sidefrom capital insourcing do you see that going down  secondly  you also talkedabout the addressable pipeline going up  any quantification can you provide inthat  and related to that is the tcv number which spiked up pretty well thisquarter  so  has there been any change in the duration in that on a blendedbasis  will that be looking different vis  vis the tcv in the past couple ofquarters  rajesh gopinathan   the in sourcing side  the commentary on it has significantly started dyingdown  but that is not to say that there are not still a few such initiatives outthere  but definitely  the widespread commentary on it has become a lot morerational and people have started internalizing the full implications of thatstrategy and the complexity of executing that strategy  so  that is definitely thecase  on and trying to see how to make sure that we share with you something thatwe are confident about  rather than speculating on what is there  but first levelanswer is  we do not see lengthening or shortening of the deal cycles  moderator   thank you  next question is from the line of yogesh agarwal from hsbc please go ahead  yogesh agarwal   rajesh  i wanted to ask again something around  the worries around the usmacro weakness  if you look at the last one year uk macro has been anythingbut you guys have done phenomenally well there and certainly the participationin the existing spend has gone up  so  just assuming things continue to getweak in the us what in your view  are there pockets of demand there wherethe participation goes up in a muted spending environment  rajesh gopinathan   difficult to say  as i said earlier  sometimes stress results in greater focus ontransformation engagements  definitely  one thing that happens is in astressed market clients prefer vendors who very clearly have the ability to ridethrough it and can invest through the cycle  so  the relative competitiveness ofsomebody like us significantly increases in a stressed market and ourattractiveness to customers actually increases manifold  so  our participationalso goes up  you see that manifest itself in various things  vendor consolidation  cleanupof a lot of maverick spending  all of that gets cleaned up and we participateaggressively in those kinds of scenarios  so  you see the retail kind of scenariowhere macro headwinds and as the stress result in technology spending  youwill see consolidation coming and flight to quality in stressed environments and we participate on both sides of the table  moderator   thank you  ladies and gentlemen  this was the last question for today  i nowhand the conference over to the management for their closing comments  overto you  sir  rajesh gopinathan   thank you  operator  so  to sum up  we had a strong q3 with revenue growingat 12 1  constant currency  the highest in the last 14 quarters and growth hasaccelerated across all geographies in our key verticals  our strongperformance and industry leading growth in digital services is on account ofour strong showing in the expanding digital transformation spend of ourcustomers  our investments in research and innovation  our contextualknowledge  our intellectual property and thought leadership have been criticaldifferentiators in helping us shape these new opportunities  we have nowlaunched a sub brand called tcs pace to further reinforce our positioning inthis very large opportunity side  in the short and medium term  we haveexcellent demand visibility  with q3 giving

TCS,presently  we are heading for multiple events like f o expiry  budget  monetary policy  etc  and the market may remain volatile and unpredictable at least till the  union budget   mazhar mohammad  chief strategist  technical research   trading advisory  chartviewindia in  said in an interview with moneycontrols kshitij anand  edited excerpts  q  in the past week  nifty managed to reclaim 10 900 but once again faltered to cross 11k  is 11 000 unconquerable for nifty ahead of budget  a  it looks like a very tricky question right now as the trend is unclear at this point in time  but  one thing which is very clear is that the nifty is still on a pullback mode from the lows of 10 004 registered in october 2018  it means this entire rally is still part of a counter trend rally as suggested by the pace of upmove and chart patterns unfolding  recent breakouts from conventional chart patterns like diamond formation  or symmetrical triangle  etc  have failed  which is a cause for concern  from elliot wave perspective  it is still a corrective up move that has kept the room open for enough downsides going forward  but  in the near term  this counter trend rally still has scope for expansion on the upside  for the counter trend rally to unfold it needs to get past 10 985 convincingly  if that happens  then we may see the index initially heading towards 11 349  presently  we are heading for multiple events like f o expiry  budget  monetary policy  etc  and the market may remain volatile and unpredictable at least untilthe  union budget   q  what are your views on bank nifty  a  well  bank nifty is looking relatively better than nifty  it  in fact  outperformed nifty50  but  last four weeks of price action is pointing towards impending weakness as it is struggling to retain gains above 27 000  for more strength  it needs a strong close above 27 600 on weekly charts  in that scenario  we dont rule out the test of new highs for this index around 28 400  this week it has registered a bearish engulfing kind of formation after a couple of narrow candles  which is a cause for concern  hence  a correction in the near term towards its 50 day ema  26 945  cant be ruled out  q  more stocks hit a fresh 52 week low in the week gone compared to stocks hitting 52 week highs  do you see we could see some buying in near future  a  when alarge number of scrips hit 52 week low  then it is a sign of weakness for the broader markets  hence  if the lined up events disappoints then this weakness may get aggravated further leading to bigger sell off whereas upsides will continue to remain limited even if the lined up events remain normal  q  in the last couple of weeks  rupee appears to have resumed its downswing  how are the charts looking  a  after bottoming at 74 48   in october 2018  therupee was on a multi week upmove and tested its critical resistance point of 69 from where it appears to have sold off once again  hence  unless it trades above 69  it continues to remain weak and trade in the range of 70 72 50    on daily charts  it has decent support in 71 3571 48 zone  and interestingly  a couple of days back it started appreciating after testing this support with a low of 71 52  hence  as long as this support is respected it can be expected to appreciate towards 70 30    on the contrary  if the support of 71 52 is breached then it can slide towards 7172

traders are advised to go long with a stop loss below rs 1 470 on a closing basis and look for a target of rs 1 579  bharat forge   buy  ltp  rs 479  target  rs 531  stop loss  rs 469  return  10 percent last three weeks of price action is looking quite interesting as this counter is registering a close around rs 480 for the last three weeks suggesting drying up of selling pressure after the vertical fall it has witnessed from the highs of rs 637 registered in last november 2018  hence  if the stock sustains above rs 470 it can make an attempt for a decent pullback rally  hence

TCS,it seems that from the current juncture  nifty may plunge towards the level of its lower band of the formation from where the bounce back is expected  sumeet bagadia  executive director  choice broking  said in an interview with moneycontrol s kshitij anand  q  it was a week which was dominated by earnings and global news flow  nifty failed to hold on to 10 800 on january 25 and closed with losses of over 1 percent  now  as we head towards the final week ahead of interim budget do you see a pre budget rally which could take the nifty towards 11000  a  yes  we are seeing a target of 11 000 but it may take a time of around two weeks  on a monthly chart  the nifty has been trading in a rising wedge formation where recently the index took the support of its lower band of the formation  this indicates a bounce back movement in the index  moreover  the index has been continuously trading with its strong support of 21 months moving average  which is placed at 10 510 level  showing that the near term trend is positive and based on which we may see an upside movement  if we talk about the daily chart  the index has been trading in an upward rising channel formation for many days  which is a continuation formation and signifies a continuous move  but  it seems that from the current juncture  the index may plunge up to the level of its lower band of the formation from where the bounce back is expected  moreover  on a lower side  the nifty has the strong support of its 200 days moving average as well which is placed at 10 729 levels  a daily rsi s reading is at 47 15 level with a negative crossover  which points out for a negative breath  however  downside at 41 levels  the rsi has strong support from where a bounce back can be expected  q  how is niftybank looking on weekly as well as daily charts  a  on the daily chart  the banknifty has been trading in an upward rising channel formation where the index has the strong support of its lower band  which comes at 27 070 level indicating a bounce back movement  moreover  the index has been trading with the strong support of 50 days moving average  which is placed at 27 018 level  again showing a bounce back movement  so we may see upside level of 27 800 while downside support comes at 27 000  so  overall it suggests a northward movement and bull may get in action  however  it may take some time as

was up 3 percent and bse sensex rallied 6 percent   india it services coverage had a solid 2018  and the index outperformed the sensex by 14 percent   morgan stanley said   revenue growth surprised positively  as global gdp growth improved and us tax reforms were enacted  and as deal pipelines swelled and key verticals  e g   bfsi  retail  grew  a depreciating inr  versus usd   operational efficiencies  and better revenue growth helped margin expansion   it reasoned for rising earnings estimates and multiple expansion  driving sizeable stock returns in 2018  the stocks of it leaders saw

good year for it names asanalysts are predicting slower global growth  especially inus and europe in addition to that  valuations are also high after the rally in the previous year  and also there could be pressure on margin on likely wage hike  morgan stanley sees hurdles going ahead and expects global growth to moderate  with developed markets  dm  slowing  primarily driven by the us  3 6 percent yoy in 2019 versus 3 8 percent yoy in 2018   in its view  consensus data already reflects strong revenue growth for f20  and valuations are at heady levels for some companies the average p e multiple for coverage at the beginning of 2018 was around 16x  with a composite revenue growth estimate of 8 6 percent yoy currently  the weighted average multiple is over 18x and 2019 revenue growth estimate is over 10 percent yoy  while the focus in 2018 was on revenue growth  morgan stanley believes it will incrementally shift to margins in 2019  spurred by two key risks increasingcost structures and likely appreciation in inr against the us dollar  the rupee depreciated around 8 percent yoy in 2018  tcs already alluded to some of these supply constraints in its december 2018 quarter call  morgan stanley cut its fy20 ebit margin estimates by 30 250bps across its coverage names largely due to potential increase in wages  here are 6 key reasons that led to downgrade of it stocks in january 2019 as listed by morgan stanley  health of the global economy economists forecast that 2019 global growth will moderate toward trend  from 3 8 percent yoy in 2018 to 3 6 percent yoy in 2019   with developed markets  dms  slowing  primarily driven by the us  tailwind from the us tax reform is also behind us  while tighter labour markets  fading fiscal stimulus  in the us   and the impact from withdrawal of monetary accommodation should slow dm growth  what s priced in  consensus revenue growth estimates for fy20 are at 9 10 percent yoy  versus 9 2 percent yoy for fy19  and are not necessarily building in any slowdown in it spends due to the macro  it spending environment the commentary on deal pipeline and the it spending environment going into 2019 seems intact  with most company managements expecting the momentum to continue  while companies such as accenture have named us china trade tensions and brexit as potential red flags for 2019  none of the indian companies have yet seen this affecting their client budgets or spending intentions  we are marginally trimming our revenue growth estimates in the base case scenario on the back of a possible slowdown in the us europe  however  our bear case scenario assumes that the macro issues increase and hinder it spends  we assume f20 revenue growth for our coverage universe to be 6 7 percent yoy in our bear case versus 9 10 percent in the base case  visa we saw several administrative changes on visa regulations through 2018  and companies have started talking about staffing issues in the us due to non availability of visa dependent workers  further  there is a likelihood of more announcements being made by the trump administration in early 2019 on the immigration h 1b process  according to newspaper report   we see these as risks to margins in 2019  as it could lead to higher onsite wage inflation and possible impact on onsite utilization  what s priced in  consensus is assuming margin expansion in fy20  while we are now assuming a yoy decline  currency movement currency forecasts assume the inr will appreciate against the usd in 2019  we have changed our f20 currency assumption from rs 71 earlier to rs 70 now to align with the recent trends  forex team forecasts rs 68 usd by december 2019 and rs 66 usd by december 2020  implying potential downside risk if this plays out

large reversals  he sees a possibility of some large corporate bank reporting surprising numbers  mookim said that fii flows will largely be linked to emerging market sentiment  bofa ml expects two rate cuts from the reserve bank of india in 2019 given the benign inflation environment  excerpts from the interview  q  what are your expectations from the new year  there will be a correction in the new year  i expect and i am worried about that  this is because i can see it happening elsewhere in the world  india is not islanded  we are not immune to the rising global cost of capital  we were benefitted when the cost of capital was falling  this is reversing and that is where i see we will get a correction in a reasonably expensive market that we have today  there is a possibility of double digit fall  q  if you are saying it will be a double digit fall so what kind of stocks one should be looking at in such a scenario  investors need to have stocks which are growth and reasonably valued  today no growth stock is reasonably valued  so more than the level of the price  i would argue that pe  price to equity  needs to come down significantly  q  do you think there is a nervousness in the market just ahead of the elections  no  not yet  q  how will markets trade ahead of the general elections  what i am hoping for is there will be a bit of correction ahead of elections and then there is some reversal to normalcy  india is that kind of market  if you get something cheap  you buy because long term potential of the economy is intact  we have hiccups in the market as market do not look at the long term it always looks at the short term  so  the risk of the correction is reasonably significant q  how would markets react if the present government doesnt get a clear majority  people more worry about the stability of the government rather than the form of the government and for whatever reason coalition is perceived to be stable i believe the market will be fine with it  whether it is this set  bjp government  or another  it is just the instability that people worry about  it will not matter for the economy even if you have an unstable government in delhi  does it really change the business cycle of the country  probably the answer is no  markets will react  stocks may fall  if they do i will come and say buy because they have fallen for the wrong reason  but it is likely that uncertainty in delhi will lead to some correction in stock markets  q  earnings season will kickstart on january 10 with  tcs  and  infosys  announcing their quarterly results  how do you think corporate earnings will pan out  it will be devoid of fireworks  there are some base effects  there are some companies which had a very bad quarter in december last year  they will therefore report optically good yoy growth but if we strip out some of that there is nothing spectacular expected in this quarter  we have already started to see earnings downgrades for this year  in fact  in the september quarter  there was the largest downgrades to corporate earnings that i have seen which is unfortunate  i do not see any more downgrades now  q  any particular sector that can surprise us  focus from the market point of view will also be on banks because they derive the largest set of profits  banks are coming of the npa cycle and are looking at large reversals  it is a possible that some large corporate banks report surprising numbers  people will focus more on that  also  some auto discretionary companies will always have some volatile numbers  q  which are the sectors that you are betting on in this year  we are overweight on financials and we are slightly tilted towards the rural space because the government has already provided a lot of support to rural income and that would include some two wheeler names  staples  tractor names  q  after the recent correction  do you think it is time to look at small and mid cap stocks  which correction  worst is yet to come  the reason i say this is that the multiple is still very high  if it goes from 60 times to 55 times in a month  that is not correction  in three months  the multiple had gone to 40 to 60  more than price levels  the valuations that need to get back in line and we are still far away from that  q  does this mean investors should stick to large caps and avoid midcaps  yes  stick to large caps  large cap stocks have halved in multiples yet investors are not buying them  on the down side  midcaps will probably fall more because there is a higher beta space  midcaps are still trading at 80 percent premium to largecaps  midcaps have corrected but they are not cheap enough  mid aps are not in the right place yet  largely  midcaps are driven by domestic sentiment  election will bring in volatility and hit domestic sentiment q  do you think the recent friction between the government and rbi is a worry factor for foreign institutional investors  fiis  who were betting on india   not yet because at least rbi had to inject a little bit of liquidity in the system which was probably needed  most are looking at the benefit for what the rbi is now doing rather than the fact that the government may have intervened  q  how do you see fii flows in 2019  it will remain linked to emerging market sentiment  flows driven by india depends on what happens in the emerging markets  correlation is very high and if you see the inflows in to ems  emerging markets   we have inflows in to india  but for whatever reason emerging market sentiment remains weak then india will also suffer because of that  q  will rbi cut rates in the coming months  yes  we think so  given the benign inflation environment  we expect two rate cuts from the rbi this year  q  lastly  what is your advice to investors

TCS,investors have to be a little cautious jumping into this market  there are larger concerns over the us slowdown  chinese demand and the expectations around the revival in corporate earnings and cues in the private capex recovery over the next few months quarters  mayuresh joshi  fund manager  angel broking  said in an interview with moneycontrols kshitij anand  edited excerpts  q  do you think this is the dip which investors can buy into  what is your outlook on markets ahead of the budget  a  investors have to be a little cautious jumping into this market  there are larger concerns over the us slowdown  chinese demand and the expectations around the revival in corporate earnings and cues in the private capex recovery over the next few months quarters  with a rural leaning budget likely this year  we should wait to see the impact on the macro finances  q  are we heading for growth slowdown in the us in 2019 or a possible recession  a  the us yield curve  which is a good barometer of a likely recession  has sloped downward  that has been a reliable indication of a likely slowdown in the past  if the trade war between the us and china does not get sorted before march  then we could see the impact of a real slowdown in growth  already  there is demand contraction visible in china  imf has projected an impact of 40 bps on global growth due to the trade war  the big challenge for indian markets will be global but dont forget that there is scope for overspending by the government on sops to farmers  q   tcs  and  infosys  will kick start earnings season next week  what are your expectations from these 2 big names of it sector  also  it topped the list in terms of sectoral gainers of 2018  do you think the trend will continue  a  the year 2018 was an advantageous year for the it industry  the us showed signs of a surge in growth while the rupee was consistently weakening through the year  that helped it companies to outperform  the year 2019 may be a different story  the us economy is showing strains in manufacturing and the trade war could only exacerbate matters  also  the dollar is showing signs of weakness and a dovish fed policy may only add to dollar weakness  the year 2019 would be mixed for the it sector  management commentaries surrounding the demand environment  digital investments adding more to the top line and sustained utilisation levels reduced attrition might hold the key  so  sticking to revenue  ebit margin guidance shall be paramount for the sector as a whole  q  any top five stocks or sectors which you are recommending to clients for a period of more than 1 year  a  from a longer term perspective  we would focus on broad consumption themes  select banks nbfcs and cement names  q  if there is a global slowdown  will india manage to sail through  given the uncertainty around upcoming general elections  a  the political arena is wide open and most political pundits have been talking about three likely outcomes  however  the markets may still prefer a stable government so that the economic reforms process is not dented  it would be presumptuous to imagine that india would be totally immune to a global slowdown  however  considering its low dependence on exports and a fairly large trade deficit  the slowdown should work in indias favour  any global slowdown is likely to hit oil prices and that would benefit indias trade deficit  it must be also said that indian markets may be best equipped to decouple from the global volatility in the medium term  q  retail investors have remained loyal to investing in equities via sip route despite wild gyrations in 2018  a report suggested that equity funds have mopped up investments worth over  17 billion that makes the fii selling figure of  4 5 billion pale in comparison  do you think the number could fall if volatility increases  a  equity mutual funds have seen consistent inflows in the last four years and that has helped indian markets to hold on despite fii selling  the more critical data point is the monthly sip inflow of nearly rs 7 900 crore that comes into equity funds  however  there is room for caution  between 2009 and 2014  equity mutual funds saw net outflows each month  any sharp correction in the market or a sudden spike in volatility can have a detrimental effect on equity mutual fund inflows  q  enormous wealth has already been created in the history  the sensex has grown like 100x in 32 years  at 15 percent cagr  do you think  2019 will also give us a similar opportunity to enter and remain invested for a long time to create wealth  a  in a long term consumer story like india  equity is always the best asset class in the long run  the indian gdp is still growing at a real rate of 7 5 percent  even a 50 bps improvement will have an enormous impact on the market cap  the consumption story in india is still intact and the capital investment cycle is yet to commence  despite having anannual gdp of rs 2 5 trillion  india has among the lowest per capita income levels in the world  this is one of the triggers for the consumer story  the answer is to remain invested in equities for the long term  q  what are your views on public sector banks after the recent rbi report suggested that the headwinds in terms of npa mess could be abating  a  psu banks have exhibited relatively stable asset quality numbers along with strong traction on the recoveries upgrades  improvement in pcrs risk weighted assets to gross advances and selective capital infusion supporting balance sheet expansion  apart from the npa cycle bottoming  there is another rs 1 trillion to be recovered by banks through the nclt process  the government is leaving no stone unturned in recapitalising these banks  credit growth has been showing signs of a pick up and if this sustains  psu banks are better placed on the valuation matrix for an earnings revival  q  what is your call on small and midcaps for 2019  how one should choose the right kind of stock for investment  a  the focus for 2019 must be more on specific consumption stories and bottom up theories rather than broad themes like midcaps or otherwise  the risk of small and mid cap stocks will continue and will largely depend on the oil prices and the stability of the inr  we believe that year 2019 may bring with it heightened risks for mid cap companies and investors need to be conscious of that  q  given that brent is trading around  55 to a barrel  what is your call on omcs and aviation stocks  a  ideally  omcs should benefit from low crude prices  it has already been announced that omcs are not taking any hit on their margins due to lower global crude prices  what the markets will be worried about is pressure on their cash flows to either declare special dividends  announce buybacks or initiating forced acquisitions and mergers  while low oil prices are good  this will remain a bid risk for omcs

WIPRO,new delhi  falling for the second week in a row  headline indices sensex and   finished with a loss of 2 per cent each for the week gone by   while the market participants attributed the fall to

3 1 per cent in may 2019 against 3 8 per cent in may 2018  inflation  as measured by the    cpi   rose to 3 18 per cent in june from 3 05 per cent in may  inflation stayed in the comfort zone  albeit at an eight month high in june  giving the rbi opportunity to cut rates again to help stimulate demand  the market is expected to react to these numbers in the coming week     the monsoon has covered almost all states of the country  delivering 28 per cent more rainfall than average in the last week  the progress of monsoon in july has reduced the rain deficit in the country substantially to only 12 per cent  from a worrying shortfall of 33 per cent at the end of june  the revival of the monsoon gives a much needed shot in the arm to agriculture and market may take a positive cue out of it    in the coming week  markets will read china s second quarter gdp numbers and industrial production prints for the month of june  japan s trade balance numbers for june and eurozone s core cpi for june

far  the flow of foreign funds will remain a key trigger for the rise and fall of the market    the rupee fell 25 paise to close at 68 69 against the us dollar on friday amid rising crude oil prices

11 620 on the upside however couldnt sustain in the higher territory  the junction of 40 hour exponential moving average and the hourly upper bollinger band also acted as a key barrier   said gaurav

moving average  bears are occupying a dominant position and are expected to drive the nifty down going ahead  on the downside  11 500 and 11 461 will be the initial levels to watch out for with a

WIPRO,the grass is always greener on the other side   some analysts prefer to say the same thing about the e commerce businesses  the biggest buzz in the industry lately    some unlisted e commerce names such as ani technologies  ola   oravel stays     and one97 communications     have been creating quite a splash in the unlisted market  mainly on the strength of their titular value  drawing in small and retail investors   many such investors flocking to these counters are not even aware of the challenges of the unlisted space  especially with regard value fluctuation and limited liquidity   many are drawn to such propositions on the lure of attractive valuations and herd mentality     according to abhishek securities  a firm dealing in unlisted shares  ola  oyo rooms and paytm are currently priced at rs 27 500  rs 75 000 and rs 17 000  respectively  in the unlisted space   that  even when these companies continue to incur losses  one 97 communications  which houses the main payments business of paytm  reported an over four fold rise in consolidated revenue in fy18 at rs 3 314 8 crore but losses swelled to rs 1 606 05 crore from rs 903 09 crore in fy17  as per data sourced from tofler   meanwhile  paytm mall reported a loss of rs 1 787 55 crore on a total revenue of rs 774 86 crore in fy18  as it looks to compete with walmart backed flipkart and amazon india  which together hold 80 per cent market share   combined losses of one 97 and paytm mall swelled 270 per cent to rs 3 393 crore in fy18 from rs 917 crore in fy17 while combined revenues went up by 417 per cent during the same period to rs 4 089 crore   for the year ended march 2018  oyo india reported a marginal widening of net loss to rs 360 crore for india operations against rs 355 crore loss reported for the previous financial year   oyo indias revenue growth has jumped over three fold  the firm reported an operating revenue of rs 416 crore for financial year 2018 compared with rs 120 crore reported for financial year 2016 17    flipkart india led the way with an unmatched margin  net loss of the e commerce giant grew over 700 per cent in fy18  though revenue growth during the period was 39 per cent  in fy18  flipkart india reported a rs rs 2 060 crore loss against rs 245 crore in the previous year   what then justifies the sky high valuations that these stocks are commanding in the unlisted space   business models in e commerce industry  in general  differ from traditional businesses  they do not owe or possess any tangible assets like land  plant  or warehouse  also  they incur huge losses and do not have any other reserve as well  despite this  their valuations keep going up to billions  remember  flipkart sold its controlling stake to   at rs 1 11 lakh crore  says sandip ginodia of abhishek securities   dinesh gupta  partner at unlistedzone com  explains the arithmetic of valuing an e commerce entity  e commerce outfits are virtual shops and they are valued by their sales  at 10 to 15 times of annual sales  the multiple may be even higher in certain cases depending on growth stage of the segment  he said     fair value of any stock is very subjective till it gets listed  different sets of people can value the same thing using different methods to arrive at different numbers  here  one sees value in something and the other does not  says ginodia   arun mukherjee  a kolkata based value investor and co founder of sebi registered sa investment advisors  says there is a great fool theory at work behind the humungous valuations that these companies command   that theory says it is possible to make money by buying securities  whether or not they are overvalued  and by selling them for a profit at a later date  this is because there will always be someone  a bigger or greater fool  willing to pay a higher price  he said   even the largest e commerce company of the world  amazon  does not make any money  ginodia points out  e commerce is a global trend  which is why such a company will be valued higher even when they do not have any asset or profits  since there is no structural mechanism  they are inflating valuations at will    e commerce is the new trend currently  but once sentiment weakens  investors may rush to offload them    these companies are valued only on the basis of top line and the growth they show  it is very hard to arrive at fair value  said ginodia   gupta says when a company is not listed  it does not need to focus on investors  it does not opt for any mechanism like rights issue or bonus issue  which may downgrade their stock value  this is why any valuation is considered okay   again  price alone cannot be a determinant of attractiveness of a stock  mrf currently trades around rs 55 000  at 20 times the eps of rs 2 600    this is does mean that the stock is not investor friendly  similarly  if   had not given any bonus or split its share  the stock value would have been rs 5 lakh today  they split it to ensure liquidity for investors  gupta said    e commerce stocks do not see much volume in the unlisted space  mostly because of high valuations  if they are to be listed in the stock market  the valuation will not be even 1 100th of what they are demanding  they are priced so high  but you would still buy it thinking that some another buyer will come later on  says mukherjee    he said investors should be very cautious while investing in the unlisted space    flipkart is making billions of losses every year  you are making sales in penny  but are valued in millions  this is crazy  there is no   in it  at some point  these bubbles will burst for sure  mukherjee said   according to him  indian customers fall for discounts and offers and this is what the e commerce companies are tapping to do business  but this is unlikely to continue forever  they will not make any profit anytime soon  perhaps next three to five years     some analysts say some promoters  like those of the e commerce giants  want their stocks to trade at a premium among select investors  this is why companies like mrf  page industries or shree cements do not opt for a stock split or bonus issues   ola has slashed all discounts and will be in profit in a year or two  people will be using ola as they have got used to it now  at a later stage  paytm may start charging a fee for its services  it is active in many services  which will  in turn  enhance revenue  this is be the business model and most e commerce companies follow the same  said gupta  ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/unlisted-market-why-e-commerce-stocks-like-ola-oyo-paytm-trade-at-eye-popping-prices/articleshow/70022055.cms,282.0,01-07-2019,,WIPRO,16:24,unlisted

WIPRO,finally  the bulls lost their control over dalal street for the first time in the last eight consecutive weeks  driven by profit booking amid monsoon concerns and caution as voting for  general elections  started and q4 earnings season kicked off by  infosys and  tcs  in week gone by  the rangebound benchmark indices settled marginally lower during the week with nifty50 falling 0 19 percent and bse sensex 0 24 percent in the week that ended on april 12  the consolidation  which started after the nifty rallying to record highs  is likely to continue not only in coming truncated week but also till mid may or till the general elections results on may 23  experts said  adding the market is expected to get support from fiis along with stable global cues  hence the major selling pressure is unlikely   nifty is showing strong resilience by consolidating in the tight range of mere 200 points after the rally of nearly 1 200 points  also  muted reactions to bad news like monsoon forecast and recent negative developments related to fmps of mutual funds suggest the absence of large selling in the market   shailendra kumar  chief investment officer at narnolia financial advisors told moneycontrol  he said though in a definitive sense where the market would be in the short term would surely be a function of the election results  the current resilience is indicating that a sharp fall  if any  would be a buying opportunity for the investors  amit gupta of icici securities said the nifty is also supported by global equity markets  which have been performing well   with brexit being delayed and us china talks continuing  comfort should continue in global markets   the flow of funds from foreign institutional investors  fiis  remained strong in week gone by as they net bought more than rs 4 000 crore worth of shares  taking the total april tally to over rs 14 000 crore  and february march april inflow to over rs 62 000 crore  as against a more than rs 15 000 crore

after a good start by it companies  the full fledged earnings season will begin in the coming week  with 38 companies announcing their quarterly results  key companies among them to watch out for would be reliance industries  wipro  hdfc bank  rbl bank  mindtree  icici lombard general insurance  etc  overall  the nifty50 companies are expected to report strong earnings in q4 driven largely by banks  and excluding banks  the growth could be in single digits while the topline is likely to remain in single digit   we expect bottomline growth of 28 6 percent in q4 fy19e  although we expect a much muted top line expansion of 3 5 percent  operating profit is expected to grow at 7 9 percent versus 2 3 percent in q3 fy19  nifty ebitda ex financials is likely to be at 18 8 percent and pat margin at 10 1 percent   elara capital said  the nifty s largecap universe is expected report a hefty 93 percent growth yoy  this is expected to lag behind the midcap and smallcap universe  which is likely to show a 236 percent profit growth yoy  here are companies which are going to announceearnings this week  wipro third major it company wipro will announce its march quarter earnings on april 16  other key thing to watch out for would be the share buyback announcement  the software firm is expected to report around 1 7 2 0 percent growth in dollar it services revenue and around 1 3 1 5 percent in constant currency which would be within its guidance of 0 2 percent constant currency growth keeping in mind the macro uncertainties  other key thing to watch out for would be its it services guidance for q1fy20   with the quarter passing by relatively unscathed on the macro front  we expect wipro s revenue growth to be in the upper half of this band  at 1 5 percent qoq cc  our usd revenue growth estimate is 2 1 percent  implying tailwind of 60bp from cross currencies   motilal oswal said  its operating performance is expected to be weak with contraction in margin  it services ebit margin is expected to decline 64bps qoq to 19 2 percent led by slowdown in bfsi and on site cost pressure  hdfc securities said  on the q1 guidance front  hdfc securities expects wipro to forecast constant currency growth in the range of 1 2 percent while motilal oswal sees the same in 1 3 percent range  key issues to watch for would be performance of healthcare vertical  comments on sustenance of growth in bfsi vertical  sustainability of margin recovery achieved in the last two quarters and the quantum of buyback that is likely to be announced with the results  reliance industries  and  hdfc bank oil retail to telecom major reliance industries will declare its march quarter results on april 18 and hdfc bank  the country s second largest private sector lender  on april 20  hence the stock reaction to both earnings will take place on april 22  monday   reliance is likely to show weak to flat growth in refinery and petrochemical segments but key things to watch out for would be telecom   retail businesses which both are expected to support earnings  motilal oswal expects 7 percent decline in refining throughput for the quarter and gross refining margin at  8 a barrel against  8 8 a barrel in q3fy19   petrochemical segment is expected to suffer due to reduced product margins   hence   reliance industries standalone earnings to be weak led by soft refining margins and lower throughput  petrochemicals earnings to be resilient   said prabhudas lilladher which expects standalone profit to down 5 percent qoq  on consolidated basis  motilal oswal expects reliance to report 6 percent sequential growth in q4 profit   positive developments in the telecom and retail segments should drive growth further for the company   key issues to watch for would be grm  petrochemical margins  telecom subscribers and future capex  in case of hdfc bank  brokerages expect more than 20 percent growth in net profit  net interest income as well as pre provision operating profit on the back of robust loan growth   loan growth is expected to remain healthy at around 23 percent yoy  driven by retail loans  while deposit growth is estimated at around 21 percent yoy  led by an increase in term deposits   motilal oswal said  adding asset quality is expected to remain stable  with gnpa at around 1 4 percent  election along with earnings  2019 lok sabha elections will continue to be a key factor to watch out for as it will decide which party will rule the country   is it the bjp  the congress or a coalition that will come to power  opinion polls suggested that the bjp led nda is expected to win around 250 270 seats in the general elections  which is closer to the halfway mark  a party  or a coalition  requires272 seats to form the government

gone by  it has negated the formation of lower highs of last three sessions  and formed a small bearish candle  which resembles a  hanging man  kind of formation on the weekly scale  the index made a lower high  lower low formation on the weekly time frame almost after 7 weeks of continuous uptrend  suggesting cautiousness on the higher side  experts said   price set up in daily scale suggests that supports are intact while weekly scale suggests that hurdles are also visible at life time high at 11 761 zones which is restricting its upside momentum   chandan taparia  associate vice president   analyst derivatives at motilal oswal financial services told moneycontrol  he said index has been consolidating in between 11 550 to 11 760 zones from last eleven trading sessions and now requires a decisive hold of 11 550 zones to retest its life time high of 11 761 and then a fresh move towards 11 888 zones  index trading below the strong psychological mark of 11 500 will extend prices lower towards crucial support of 11 420 and below that towards monthly pivot point levels 11 360  said shabbir kayyumi  head of technical   derivative research at narnolia financial advisors  f o cues nifty index remained in the grip of option writers for the second consecutive week  and otm option premium fell down because of theta decay even after its jump in volatility  on the option

unwinding is at immediate strike price  option band signifies a trading range in between 11 550 to 11 750 zones  chandan taparia said  india vix moved up sharply by 14 19 percent in the last week to 21 mark  the highest in last six months due to the hedging done by market participants especially in may 30 derivatives contracts  india vix suggests momentum  but the risk is rising for taking fresh trade at higher zones  chandan taparia said  amit gupta said if it sustains above this  it may lead to volatility levels seen before 2014 elections to before reaching levels of 30 percent  corporate

team  our performance in both revenue andmargins has been robust  let me quickly provide you an update on q3 and our view of the demand environment and theprogress on the six strategic themes that i talked to you about every quarter  in constant currencyterms  our it services revenue grew by 2 4  which is within the guidance range  amongst the verticals  our banking and financial services vertical and consumer verticalcontinue to do well and along with the energy and utilities vertical  three verticals have grownover 10  yoy in constant currency  technology has had a muted growth which is normal inq3 because of furloughs but the outlook remains quite stable  communications has grown wellat 2 1  in constant currency  healthcare is likely to remain soft as we overcome the uncertaintyaround aca  the demand environment in the global market is stable  we do not see any immediate impact ofthe macro headwinds that some of the large economies have cautioned  but we continue toremain quite watchful  the traction in us and asia pacific and other emerging markets remains healthy and the growththis quarter is across industry segments  india will continue to remain little volatile as weundergo the restructuring and transformation of our business  been talking about  we remain committed to driving profitable growth and high quality ofrevenues  now  let me quickly share the update on our strategic themes  our digital revenue continues togrow strongly  and increased 6 4  sequentially and 35 4  yoy in q3  it now contributes 33 2 of our overall revenues  our clients are increasingly drawing on the power of wipro digitalcombined with wipros traditional business to deliver new products  services and experiencesto their clients and employees  all of this is enabled by the digitally trained workforce whichnow is over 130 000 employees  just to give you an example of the kind of deals we are executing  a north america basedpublishing company has awarded a multi year process simplification and user experiencetransformation contract to wipro  leveraging our expertise in cloud  agile and wipro digitalsdesign centric approach through our designit acquisition  we will optimize the clients globalinventory and supply chain processes and enable and enhance experience for clients andconsumers  i continue to remain quite satisfied by our efforts on customer mining and the results have beenquite robust across all buckets despite a quarter with furloughs which primarily impacts our largecustomers  in q3  our top 10 clients grew 6 3  sequentially in constant currency terms and 14  yoy andour top 5 clients grew 9 7  sequentially and 19 1  yoy  we have added one client in the  100million bucket  two in  50 million plus bucket and seven clients in the  20 million plus bucket we continue to add various different service lines to our existing customers to drive this growth in this quarter  we have won incremental business to an existing infrastructure customer and noware servicing them in the data analytics and artificial intelligence space  this will see ourexisting footprint expand as the customer embarks on its 2020 focused transformation journey  on non linearity  we continue to invest in intellectual property  during q3  we filed 60 newpatents taking our total patent applied count to 2 113 with about 492 granted patents within ourportfolio  and a large number of these patents are in futuristic technology areas around dataanalytics  artificial intelligence  wireless technologies and so on and so forth  we continue to execute quite well on automation or what we call as hyper automation essentially leveraging our ip which is wipro holmes platform which is now in over 350 ofour clients  the measure that we use to quantify our automation which is work done by bots  hasimproved in our fixed price projects from about 3  work in q2 to about 6 7  work in q3  andour fixed price mix has improved to about 59 8   localization initiative  of investments through wipro ventures now stands at 18  we incubated three new themes through our horizon program during the quarter  again in thearea of intelligent networks  customer life cycle management and service management  wecontinue to see strong traction on crowdsourcing on our top coder platform  crowdsourcing platform top gear has now onboarded 29 600 plus employees on the platform taking the total number of employees registered on the platform to over 90 000  this quarter2 186 project challenges were executed successfully  taking the total to about 5 000 plus projectsin this financial year  we continue to gain recognition with industry analysts and out of over 300 reports in whichwipro gets mentioned  we are in the leaders quadrant in 200 reports  to conclude  we remain quite focused on execution on both revenue and margins as we build onour momentum on the back of strong customer relationships  deep investments in digital andother big bets and consistently improving on our operating metrics and innovating the nextgenerationdelivery model while we remain watchful of the macro environment  now  i will request you jatin  to talk about the financials  of q3 which is mentioned in our press release  we will be very happy to take your questions from here on  moderator   thank you very much  we will now begin the question and answer session  the first questionis from the line of sandeep agarwal from edelweiss  please go ahead  sandeep agarwal   abid  i have just two questions  first of all  i just wanted to know now you have spoken thatdigital is now 33  of our business and it is growing at 35   so  almost we are talking about10  yoy growth from digital alone for the overall company  i would like to know how muchdeterioration in the balance of the business has already happened or what i would like tounderstand is will the balance of the business continue to decline or remain stable which willlead to digital becoming 50  60  of the overall business going forward or do you think that largepart of pain in the non digital side has already been behind and going forward it will at least bestable to some low single digit growth  that is question  1  question  2 on digital again generally  we have seen in last 20  25 years of history that a particular business line or segmentwhen it becomes 30  35   then we start getting lot of margin benefit and also the growthnumbers start coming down a little bit  i understand that digital is not a segment or a vertical andit is across  so obviously maybe our whole business becomes digital in next five years  that isthe possibility  so  what is your sense  are we close to that number where probably the 35  40 growth rate will cool off and the margins will also start improving significantly  matured like the migration to the cloud or some of the customer experience and design areas there are still lot of investment areas across artificial intelligence  machine learning  big data etc   so  it is kind of a portfolio which still continues to require investments in spite of we beingable to command a slight pricing premium as well as higher margins in this part of the business  sandeep agarwal   one question  abid  you probably missed which i wanted to know  as you said that next four five years  everything will be digital  so  does that mean also that this 35  40  rate are notsustainable because some portion as you mentioned cloud migration  other things would be inthe matured phase while others like artificial intelligence  automation  iot may be at initialphase  if you can clarify little bit on that  abidali z  neemuchwala   of course  as the volume grows  the pace will slow down  but also remember the market size isincreasing because technology is becoming part of every industry unlike 20  25 years back whentechnology was only used for back office processing  now technology is becoming the product so some of the areas especially in our engineering services business  our mobile and digitalexperience piece of the digital business is finding new stakeholders  new areas of application intraditional industries which creates a much bigger market size  so as the pie increases becauseof the base effect  the growth rates will slow down  but there is more market also that is gettingcreated  i think we will get a fair share of our pie in the market  moderator   thank you  the next question is from the line of nitin padmanabhan from investec  please goahead  nitin padmanabhan   the first one is  if you look at the way our hedges are and we take it on the revenue line  do youthink going into next year just the hedges alone will provide a good tailwind for margin for thewhole year  the second question is if you look at the fixed price project  which is closer to 60 now  and in the context of rising onsite cost with the supply tightness there  our ability to sort ofabsorb that with the fixed price kind of situation  do you see that sort of impacting margins whenwe think from a slightly longer term perspective considering that the supply side may remaintight  we internally of course work with a tight regiment of fixed outcome on forex that businesscan work with and build their cost structures around it and we leave the volatility of the forexto be managed in good hands of our treasury  so overall  i will say it has played out well so farthis year and we will continue to see how it pans out  on your second question on increase impactof the localization as a cost  i would put a couple of points and i will request saurabh to talkabout the cost of localization and our endeavors there  but very principally fixed price projectmeans that our delivery team owns outcome and therefore they have higher maneuverabilityaround the type of automation they can put in  type of resources they can engage with  so to thatextent in fact it is less of an impact on fixed price projects  on t m side  you are able to priceyourself as you go  so to that extent you are also not impacted there too  but overall localizationas a theme is a very important theme for our competitiveness in future  i request saurabh to talkabout  saurabh govil   nitin  on localization  it is a journey which we started three years back  it is not that we havestarted today  i think we saw it coming early  we have doubled our localization in key marketsover the last three years in a very planned fashion  we have first started hiring locally  then nowwe have made a good network from local colleges  building teams  training people  creatingdevelopment centers across a big market of north america and doing it  so it is not suddenreaction to managing demand there  because we anticipated it  planned it and we are movingahead  there is a crunch of stem talent in the us  but that is true and we feel that we are muchbetter positioned given that we have done it in a much planned fashion  nitin padmanabhan   i think almost the entire or bulk of the growth has entirely come from digital operations andplatforms which we earlier used to call bpo  so in that context do you see the rest of the practiceis sort of pulling up going forward  what is your thought there  and second is in the context ofthe ops sort of growth and it is pretty broad based  just your thoughts on how that sort of workedyour way  number primarily because of certain geographical restructuring that we are looking at  butoverall all the propositions are becoming very relevant for the market and it is also validated bythe external analyst reports that we see where we are being rated as leaders in about 200 of thereports that we have participated of the 300 that we work with  moderator   thank you  the next question is from the line of ravi menon from elara capital  please goahead  ravi menon   first is a book keeping question  you used to provide the cost of revenue  sales and marketingand g a for it services and it products separately you yourself evaluate it services margin could you give that please  jatin dalal   the investor relations team will circulate it and publish it shortly after the call  ravi menon   secondly on q4 guidance  it seems slightly muted  any headwinds that you anticipate especiallyin the healthcare or something else that you want to call out  the transformation of our india business which will continue to be a little volatile next couple ofquarters  and that has been incorporated  and fundamental transformation of our manufacturingbusiness which may take another couple of quarters  that has been incorporated as well otherwise  mostly we see demand in line with what we have been seeing in the past few quarters  ravi menon   and  abid  one last question about health business unit there you said that open enrollment areactually pe 10  of enrolment  this quarter you posted pretty good growth in the health businessunit  so  any large deals there that has helped positive growth  jatin dalal   ravi  since your voice was not very clear  is your question  why the health has seen a growth inq3 when open enrolment actually fell as per abids commentary  ravi menon   that is right  sorry  i have a very bad cold  jatin dalal   so  ravi  that is because our open enrolment does have some one time increase when we actuallycomplete that annual activity in q3  and that has flown into the revenue stream for q3  but ona secular basis there will be a decline that will be visible from q4 onwards  moderator   thank you  our next question is from the line of vibhor singhal from phillipcapital  please goahead  for long this has been our weak link  and now with whatever prices that the crude is at  beinghighly volatile  what is the outlook that you see for this segment  last few years  and also it is reflected in a very provision for doubtful debt recovery in q3  andthat is reflected in terms of lower g a expenses for quarter  abidali z  neemuchwala   bala is on the call  ns bala  who is our president for the energy and utilities business will giveyou a color on that business which has been transformed quite well  have been able to create  vibhor singhal   so  bala  if i could just probe a bit further on that  basically  is the transformation solely drivenby our initiative of aligning our investments to their requirements  or are we also seeing anincreased demand  or lets say a momentum  from their side in terms of deal flow size whichcould probably give us more visibility about the future quarters  n  s  bala   there is a little bit of both in that  vibhor  i would say that the customers are continuing to spenda little bit more aggressively on application modernization  but the bigger impact has actuallybeen the alignment of our investments to the modernization that the customers are doing as wellas on the digital work that they are doing in data analytics space  and like i said the clocktransformation  so that is actually yielding the results like i said  vibhor singhal   sure  so  would it be safe to assume  barring any macro shocks or any unforeseen events  ourrevival in this segment should probably continue  maybe at a higher or a lower pace than whatit was this quarter  not to do with the number  but directionally do you believe it should continuein the positive direction that it has been over the last few quarters  n  s  bala   yes  we believe that we have kind of stabilized the major issues that were impacting us in thepast  so i would say that there is a reasonable degree of positivity about next few quarters  iwould not comment on how much that could be  but in general  directionally like you said  weseem to be headed in the right direction  vibhor singhal   jatin  just last thing on the g a expense that you mentioned  as you mentioned the reason thatthis quarter  we saw a good recovery in provisions  so considering this as an exception  i meanthis kind of a recovery in this quarter  do you believe the g a expense to probably revert to theearlier quarterly run rates that we had before  not necessary the last quarter  but lets say if iwere to take the average of the last six or seven quarters  that could generally be the forwardlookingg a expense  jatin dalal   that is right  vibhor  i think right way that you have explained  we should look at a trend overa few quarters because there have been ups and downs if you see the g a trend over the lastsix quarters  moderator   thank you  our next question is from the line of viju george from jp morgan  please go ahead  viju george   i had a question on the analyst mentions that you sighted  you said that you are regarded as aleader in 200 of the 300 reports  if you look at some of the common areas where you haveleadership  because this i think also looks at some of your peers as well  what could be thoseareas where you think you have got leadership with respect to peers as identified by these analystreports  abidali z  neemuchwala   so  typically when you look at these reports  as you rightly said  two or three of our peers wouldalso be participating there  but in some reports  especially in the new age areas of digital  ai some of the stuff that we talked about  business transformation in the areas of data and analytics i think we are creating a differentiated capability and that gets reflected in these reports  viju george   and these are all technologies and capabilities that has been integrated into larger projects as wespeak as well  i presume  abidali z  neemuchwala   that is correct  viju george   on margin improvement  yes  i think it is g a driven  what will be our target or the comfortmargin operating range  because at some level we could say that you might still have someroom to move up  given where peer margins are  but on the other hand some guys would saythat peer margins might have to move down  so  from wipros perspective  for the growth itwants to achieve  is there a target  not a guidance but kind of a target margin range where youfeel comfortable  where there will always be  quarterly variation  for example  in the current quarter we have givensalary increases to some of our people which will impact our margins in q4  and we willcontinue to  as i said  remain invested and make incremental investments even in q4 on our bigbets  so that would be an additional step  so  overall  viju  the answer is  yes  we feel comfortablein the trajectory which we have demonstrated in q2  q3  but goal will be to do investment  createdifferentiation and create growth  very sustainable here on where you can have broad based growth for many more verticals beyondbfsi  and therefore make it much easier for wipro to close the revenue gap relative to largerpeers if you have participation  do you think we are beginning to tick those boxes as we speak  abidali z  neemuchwala   that is right  viju  you rightly observed  if you look at the constant currency q on q growthacross our verticals  except technology which also as you know is because of the furlough impactis maximum in the technology vertical  i am very pleased with a very secular growth acrossvarious verticals that we have seen  a couple of them may have a couple of more volatile quarterslike manufacturing or health  but at least three of the six business units have delivered doubledigityear on year growth for us  so  that does feel quite comfortable to me  viju george   you feel that this can sustain going forward that we would not have  out the volatility  i feel quite comfortable that it is sustainable  we have got good customeracquisitions  we have got good deal flow  we have good demand pipeline and we have gotcapabilities and offerings that we have invested in and we have customized for those domainswhere we see good customer attraction  viju george   sure  and lastly  i am sorry for taking too much time  abid  all of yours incremental growthcomes in digital and typically there is a view that digital is important for clients competitiveadvantage  so  do you think that when you look at the nature of development work that is comingfor you and maybe for industry  since it is strategic  since it is competitive advantage driven  itbecomes less susceptible to macro shift  or you think if clients want to cut back they will cutback regardless of whether digital or not  are we more resilient today than seven  eight yearsback  look at the nature of developmental spending that is coming out  revenue generating activities and i would believe that the impact would not be as high  again we have not seen a cycle of slowdown post the digital transformation era  so this is stillsomething which needs to be tested out  but i would agree with you on the basic hypothesis  moderator   thank you  our next question is from the line of sumit jain from goldman sachs  please goahead  sumit jain   so  firstly  wanted to understand on your margin front we have seen a pretty good sharpimprovement and you highlighted g a as one of the reasons  but if i probe about the othermargin levers  can you comment a bit on your onsite effort and utilization  how much more roomdo you have  because particularly on the onsite effort you guys are at 22  which is one of thelowest compared to your peers  and given that more the new digital projects have more onsitecentric nature  can you believe that you can still further increase the offshoring out there  this automation is with us  similarly on development side of the house  internal crowd sourcingthat we do which i update on the top gear theme is what delivers savings  and a lot of theimprovement that you see in margin comes from those operational levers  so those are thefuturistic operation levers  and i wouldnt limit our conversation only to utilization andoffshoring and those kind of levers which we continue to work on nonetheless  i will let jatinkind of give a more specific split of the numbers  jatin dalal   so  sumit  thanks for your question  and in some form i think which you also mentioned  and iwant to clarify that  it is optically looking like that there are lower g a expenses but there aretwo opposite impacts there  our cost of delivery has certainly improved due to the factors justthat abid spoke about  automation  better execution of fixed priced projects  crowd sourcing andso on and so forth  we do have a slightly higher expense line on depreciation and amortizationin q3 which is impacting that overall line  and we have an offset of that in some form in formof a superior execution on pdd  so overall improvement is seeming like optically from the g aline  but the way we look at it as a management is really superior execution of delivery that wehave done  sumit jain   thats helpful  my second question is around  i mean  you guys have seen achieving a very highlocalization in us  almost to 63  kind of levels now  so  can you just comment what kind ofutilization and attrition levels are you seeing in us for yourself  are they higher  lower thanyour company average typically  cost sitting in the us  but there is something which needs to be looked at very carefully  becausewe are seeing a situation where attrition can go up there  given the crunch of the stem talent inthe country  sumit jain   and maybe lastly on your capital allocation policy  any thoughts around the share buyback  willwe see in this financial year  and lets say in case it gets pushed out to the next financial year how are you planning to maintain your capital allocation policy of around 45  to 50  of netincome being paid out  jatin dalal   so  sumit  we have shared this before  we are dependent on completion of our merger of oursubsidiaries  and it is taking procedurally a longer time than what we initially envisaged  so wewill play it by the year  as i have mentioned  we have always looked at payout policy over blockof years  so as and when one is deciding the next dividend payout or next payout decision  onewould be able to calibrate in what point in time we are and therefore what should be the rightdecision around it  moderator   thank you  our next question is from the line of sandeep shah from cimb  please go ahead  sandeep shah   just  abid  question is in terms of guidance  so if i look at last year fourth quarter we still had aslightly higher portfolio related issues and the contributions from those  including india washigher which might have declined over four quarters  at that time we had guided 1   2   3 kind of growth rates  this time with more confidence on the demand as well as the deal closureswhich are happening  we are guiding for 0  to 2   so you are saying you are factoring macroissues  but in your initial remarks you also said there is no immediate impact of the macro  so can you give us some color why this is  if you can clear some confusion on this   our healthcare business  specifically hps and the lower enrollment  the two others are aroundboth macroeconomic situation which we are very watchful of  primarily both in our largemarkets  in the us as well as in the uk  and as we keep seeing renewals  as you know this isend of the year timeframe where a lot of our contracts get renewed  which are annual contractsor quarterly contracts and as we see the pace of those renewals our confidence continues to goup  right now we have guided based on the current state that we see  as i said  our order bookinghas been really robust over the last two quarters and some of that gets reflected in the guidanceas we ramp up those deals in the january  february  march quarter and q1 of next financial year  sandeep shah   jatin  question on the margins  so based on the replies which you have given  you mean to saythat 19 8  is a maintainable margin with a narrow band  is it the way we should look for  jatin dalal   i think you should look at the improvement that we have done in q2 and q3  i think there willbe quarterly volatilities in every quarter  including some of the investments that we continue tomake  as i mentioned  and i think our endeavor would be to remain in this trajectory  sandeep shah   so  you mean to say 18 6  to 19 8  is the trajectory which you are looking  which is q2  q3margins  jatin dalal   yes  that is right  but there is forex includes there  etc  so  i am therefore not quantifying anumber or a band which can be deemed as a guidance  i am saying this is the operationalexecution that we are comfortable around  there will be puts and takes  there will be forexvolatility  but this trajectory is what we are comfortable about  sandeep shah   just one clarification  if i look at the line item lifetime expected credit loss and a provision fordeferred contract cost  on q on q there is almost like a positive swing of rs  170 crores whichis rs  112 basis point to the consolidated revenue  at the same time  you also mentioneddepreciation has some impairment which is some 83 5  which is rs  84 crores  so  roughly putsand takes if you look at  the positive impact is still higher by close to around rs 70 crores  rs 80 crores  so how should we look at it  will it reverse going forward  demonstrated in past by a margin  sandeep shah   so  for the negative number is it largely the earlier bad debts being recovered or there issomething else also in terms of lifetime  abidali z  neemuchwala   no  this is when we execute projects and they are dependent on certain outcome that we are ableto demonstrate or sometimes it is just the delay on customer side to process payment  especiallyif it is linked with any bureaucratic sort of organization  so we have provided based on our policyof time base which we provided  and then we did recovery it came as a positive  moderator   thank you  our next question is from the line of surendra goyal from citigroup  please goahead  surendra goyal   abid  are you being able to retain the gains that you achieved due to such sharp increase inautomation levels  or is this in line with what was already promised to the customer  andfollow up on the same question  jatin  so this kind of benefits which come because of any marginimprovement should be visible at a gross margin level  is that understanding right  abidali z  neemuchwala   so  surendra  right now both automation gains and forex gains if you see  we have been ableto retain and pass it through  reflecting in our operating margins  over time as you know verywell  when deals come up for renewals and productivity milestones hit some of these things needto be shared with customers  which is the normal rhythm of our business  goods sold line  surendra goyal   sorry  could you just clarify  what is the additional cost in cost of goods line  jatin dalal   so  this in some form the amortization line and couple of other expenses which is higher  andg a where we had a large pdd reversal is sitting as a gain  and therefore you are seeing it asa gain  so you are not seeing the benefit of operational improvement in the cost of goods soldline  moderator   thank you  ladies   gentlemen  that was the last question  i now hand the conference over toaparna iyer for closing comments  aparna iyer   thank you all for
