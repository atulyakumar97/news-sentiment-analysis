ICICI BANK,we expect the nifty earnings to grow at a cagr of 20 percent between fy1921 and the economic fundamental is likely to improve further given this backdrop the longterm prospects look very attractive and hence investors should buy into dips professor ravi sundar muthukrishnan headinstitutional equity research elara capital said in an interview with moneycontrols kshitij anand edited excerpts q the new year started off on a muted note with key benchmark indices slipping below crucial support levels and moving averages do you think this is the dip which investors can buy into a our analysis suggests that months preceding general elections market volatility increases heightened concerns around global slowdown trade wars brexit monetary tightening in some developed markets will add to the market volatility in the short term however we expect the nifty earnings to grow at a cagr of 20 percent between fy1921 and the economic fundamental is likely to improve further given this backdrop the longterm prospects look very attractive and hence investors should buy into dips q are we heading for growth slowdown in the us in 2019 or a possible recession a incremental data points for key developed and emerging marketsjapan germany brazil and south africa apart from the us and chinapoint towards a challenging environment for global growth over the next 12 months the ongoing uschina trade war brexit and the tussle between the us fed and us administration are additional concerns in light of all this it is not incorrect to say that most of the worries are global in nature and the global slowdown signs are ominous q any top five stocks or sectors that you are recommending to clients for a period of more than 1 year a some investment themes for cy19 are 1 we expect banks to do well with the continuation of robust growth in retail and services credit in h2cy19 we can expect a recovery in corporate credit  icici bank and hdfc bank  2 infrastructure is likely to see the improved pace of execution and will be a key positive for players who have tied their financials and those with strong execution capabilities  pnc infra  3 capital goods companies particularly in transmission distribution and transportation are witnessing strong order inflows and are favourably placed  kec international  4 consumer durables companies will benefit from a low penetration levels b shortening replacement cycles and c cost reductions driven by import substitution and supply chain efficiencies due to gst  crompton consumer  5 auto companies are expected to register stronger revenue growth on the back of declining fuel prices new product launches and benign or reducing interest rate environment  maruti  hero motocorp  q amid the global slowdown do you think india will be able to sail through the political drama unfolding in the first half of 2019 a while we do expect india to feel the impact of slowing global economy but we are far more insulated compared to other exportoriented ems benign inflation falling commodity prices pause or fall in interest rates increase in rural consumption due to loan waivers elections spending rural welfare schemes investment and public capex as well as earnings recovery will bode well for indian equities the political drama will keep the market circumspect till may but in h2cy19 we expect the market to do well on the back of strong economy and company fundamentals q a report suggests equity funds have mopped up investments worth over 17 billion that makes the fii selling figure of 45 billion pale in comparison do you think the number could fall if the volatility increase a usually we find retail investors pulling out money in times of market correction therefore strong sip flows is a positive signal  despite 13 percent correction after august 2018 peak retail investors have stuck to sips taking a cue from this we expect financialisation trend to continue despite the market volatility moreover lack of investment opportunities in other asset classes especially in mumbai and ncr which account for 50 percent of the sips we expect strong sip flows to continue q the sensex has grown like 100x in 32 years at 15 percent cagr do you think 2019 will also give us a similar opportunity to enter and remain invested for a long time to create wealth a equity as an asset class is well placed to provide superior returns over the long term india is and will likely remain the fastest growing major economy over the next few years at least also we believe we are leaving behind the low corporate earnings growth environment and are at the cusp of a strong earnings recovery cycle if you put all these together i believe that there will be opportunities to generate superior returns over the long term q what are your views on public sector banks after the recent rbi report suggested that the headwinds in terms of npa mess could be abating a we expect a revival in corporate credit growth in fy20 albeit in the second half due to electionrelated uncertainties infrastructure sector 35 percent of industrial credit is showing initial signs of recovery after a prolonged contraction and we expect it to lead the industrial credit growth over fy2021 after the nclt resolutions we also expect the credit cost to decline on an average by 7080 bps for the banking sector though the environment is improving for the sector we continue to like private sector banks and only a select public sector banks q what is your call on small anf midcaps for 2019 how should one choose the right kind of stock for investment a we expect midcaps to outperform in 2019 on the back of a valuation comfort as midcaps are trading at 8 percent discount to largecaps and b softer crude and commodity prices that can provide support to costsmargins nifty midcap 100 currently has a low net profit margin of 39 percent and also spur earnings growth due to low base among midcaps we prefer low leverage and reasonably valued stocks with a earning visibility for the next two years b high qualityefficient management top brands an industry leader first mover advantage and capital allocation discipline and c location advantages eg cement q given that brent is trading around 55 to a barrel what is your call on omcs and aviation stocks a we estimate global refining capacity utilisation to be around 839 percent by cy19 and 842 percent by cy20 up from 835 percent in cy17 and 839 percent in cy18 nearing the historical level of 85 percent during cy0406 which is likely to strengthen refining margin we like omcs that are more into refining and diesel constitutes a major chunk of their refining output the double whammy of rising crude and inr faced by aviation is now behind us we expect the benefit of falling crude which constitutes 30 percent of input costs and inr strengthening to improve raskcask margin and the whole of h2fy19 to benefit q tcs and infosys will kick start earnings season this week  what are your expectations from these two big names of the it sector a we expect infosys to maintain its margin guidance and continue to expect that the new band of 2224 percent target to be maintained and also expect tcs to widen the ebit margin gap with infosys this quarter no doubt it had a strong price performance in 2018 but we think it is unsustainable in cy2019 due to headwinds in terms of

auto mm eicher motors hero motocorp escorts and ashok leyland are stocks to watch out for the performance of sales for october and november were pretty mixed with subdued data from maruti suzuki india hence any revival in sales would be key things to watch out for fo expiry and technical outlook the futures and options contracts of january will expire on january 31 and traders will roll over their positions to february series so there could be volatility in the coming week experts said maximum put open interest oi is at 10800 followed by 10700 and 10500 strikes while maximum call oi is at 11000 followed by 10900 and 11100 strikes call writing was seen at 10800 followed by 10900 strikes and put unwinding was seen at 10500 followed by 10800 and 10600 strikes hence option band signifies a lower trading range between 10700 and 10900 experts said nifty short build which was not closed near 11000 is getting rolled into the february series as well as certain nifty stocks are losing sheen the index may consolidate for a longer time amit gupta of icici securities said on january 25 nifty breached its noticeable put base of 10800 if the index doesnt recover immediately the expiry week may witness selling pressure on account of closure of put writing positions according to him the nifty50 ended the week 12 percent lower at 1078055 and formed bearish candle on the weekly chart that implies the index may continue facing resistance on rise around critical resistances overall the index has been rangebound between 1070010980 for past many weeks and the same range is expected to remain in the coming week as well technical experts said the index has closed below all the major moving averages50 100 and 200suggesting selling pressure however the ascending triangle formed on the daily chart of nifty suggests immediate support at 10740 recent rangebound movement may persist as adx on the weekly chart remains below 20 shabbir kayyumi head of technical research at narnolia financial advisors said jaydeb dey of stewart  mackertich said the most critical resistance is placed around 10980 however breaking down 10650 also looks unlikely as long as the global scenario

ICICI BANK,ravi krishnan in the chanda kochhar case nobody comes out smelling of roses neither the board of icici bank nor the government regulators or the central bureau of investigation cbi a year after initiating a preliminary enquiry the investigating agency has charged the former managing director and ceo of icici bank her husband his companies videocon group md venugopal dhoot and a clutch of that groups firms in a first information report fir the cbi has alleged that these people conspired to defraud icici bank of rs 1730 crore the matter pertains to an alleged quidproquo transaction involving deepak kochhar and dhoot the fir says vn dhoot transferred rs 64 crore to nupower renewable managed by deepak kochhar on august 9 2009 a day after a rs 300crore loan was disbursed to a videocon group company chanda kochhar was a member of the panel which sanctioned that loan on the face of it  and thats the clear conclusion drawn by cbi  it appears to be a case of quid pro quo this is of course just an fir the first step towards an investigation and the subsequent filing of a charge sheet but it does raise a question on what due diligence the icici board did before jumping to kochhars defence in the first place on march 28 2018 the board issued an unequivocal clean chit to kochhar it announced an independent probe much later on may 30 and kochhar herself stepped down in midjune 2018 now its up to the cbi to prove in court that the transaction was indeed a quid pro quo for sanctioning a loan but thats beside the point the fact that deepak kochhar had lots of transactions and joint ownership with dhoots firms and the fact that chanda did not recuse herself from the sanctioning committee should have been enough for the board to pull up the ceo that the board didnt do that is appalling here the role of the government and the regulator the reserve bank of india must be called into question as well the conflict of interest allegation was raised by an investor arvind gupta as early as 2016  he had written to the prime ministers office and rbi but his complaints got little attention did rbi investigate did it call for an investigation by the board these are questions that the banking regulator has to answer if rbi had nipped this issue in the bud then the kochhar case wouldnt have festered for so long theres a third aspect icici bank sanctioned some rs 1575 crore to videocon group entities in this chanda kochhar personally was part of the sanctioning committee for two term loans of rs 300 crore and rs 750 crore secondly the fir says some of the loans to group companies of videocon was to help them repay their loans to the parent it also said one of the loans to videocon industries was to refinance its existing loans and these violated the banks credit policy no doubt that suspiciously sounds like evergreening but again the charges need to be proved till here the fact that chanda kochhars conduct in these matters needs to be investigated is a reasonable conclusion to make but the cbi is spreading the net wide the fir goes on to name a list of senior officials and board members who were part of the sanctioning committees for these loans and says their role may be investigated as these loans turned nonperforming that sounds like a witch hunt and confuses a specific case of quid pro quo with a commercial business decision having gone wrong and icici bank was not the only one whose loan was not repaid remember that icici bank was part of a consortium led by state bank of india that lent rs 40000 crore to videocon that entire amount has turned bad is that a lapse in due diligence by icici or all banks in its zeal cbi seems to have started questioning commercial decisions the july 2018 chargesheeting of some retired psu bankers is one clear example this zealous chargesheeting of all and sundry associated with a bad loan will lead to the return of fear psychosis among bankers not a good idea when the countrys economic managers want to boost loan growth,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/opinion-cbi-fir-in-chanda-kochhar-case-raises-more-questions-than-it-answers-3436201.html,1725.1,25-01-2019,1725.2,AKZOINDIA,15:46,opinion  cbi fir in chanda kochhar case raises more questions than it answers,moneycontrol

about 184 billion rupees at september 30 2018 pl details 2019 from 4793 billion rupees in q2 of 2018 from nonperforming loans for the banking system in september while the bank has been passing on the increase in cost of deposits to borrowers by hiking the mclr and the incremental lending rates the impact of the same on margins would come with a lag due to the lower reset frequency of loans linked to mclr year in q2 of 2019 the costtoincome ratio was 452 in q2 of 2019 compared to 440 in q2 of 2018 which excluded gains from stake sale in subsidiaries the bank had 83927 employees at september 30

september 30 2018 we will now be happy to take your questions adajania from idfc please go ahead ratings  upgrades are of  41 billion of which around  19 billion is steel based on the internal ratings which are done by the risk team of the bank the other upgrades are spread across companies and include one case in which there was a change in management which happened a few quarters back because you had mentioned that as a concern last quarter epc company and some other accounts on the builder finance portfolio we are monitoring that portfolio closely as of now we are comfortable with the portfolio mahrukh adajania just in terms of margins again you would have seen a lot of interest from npls is that the reason why margins grew quarter because the june quarter had quite a big impact of the resolution of one of the steel accounts from the list1 of the nclt so we did have interest collection in the september quarter but the amount while being large was smaller than what we had in the june quarter mahrukh adajania then what explains the increase in margin rakesh jha in terms of the margin the funding cost has remained broadly at a similar level in the september quarter compared to june quarter and we have been able to improve the yields somewhat the fact that we have deployed some of the surplus liquidity on to the lending side has also helped the margin as i mentioned earlier there has been an increase in the funding cost that the system has seen from september onwards and then going forward that will result in the funding cost going up and we will be focused on trying to pass that on to the lending side as well mahrukh adajania what about the overseas margin they have been so volatile so when do they stabilize will continue to see this volatility in the current financial year and even the september number that you see includes some benefit of interest collection from npls i think as we get into the next financial year is when we should start seeing some stability there otherwise you will indeed find that margin to be volatile during the rest of the current financial year fy2020 rakesh jha we would report that number as the collections happen there is no estimate that we have on that moderator thank you we will take the next question from the line of kunal shah from edelweiss please go ahead are there a few segments which get into the decongestion category that was the focus area which we have continued at the bank in the current quarter as well in terms of opportunities as you say in the current environment on the lending side the opportunity is there across each and every segment on the retail side on the corporate side and even on the sme side and you would have seen that the growth across each of these segments has been quite consistent in the current quarter and at a relatively high level the opportunities are there in each of the segments and we will as sandeep has communicated be focusing on risk calibrated profitable growth in each of these segments such do we also see nims broadly bottoming out or maybe we could say it has already bottomed out and we should only see improvement hereon second half of the current financial year the funding cost will go up for all the banks including us and as i said we will be focused on passing on the increase in funding cost on to the lending side but we will have to just see how that plays out so i would not want to say that margins have bottomed out for the system per se but our focus will definitely be to ensure that we pass on all the increase that we see onto the lending side only with respect to the spv or even if we have any exposure to the spv level we would have downgraded that as well as the entire group how should we read into it is this only the exposure to few entities or this is the overall exposure to that group billion out of that was downgrade in the drilldown list which is the power steel rigs and those sectors then there was downgrade that we had towards the group engaged in infrastructure as you mentioned and there were some other accounts there is no specific number that we have given for any specific account these are the aggregate numbers  821 billion is not pertaining to the infrastructure company it is pertaining to the drilldown list in aggregate that is power steel rigs and these sectors which we have been disclosing separately moderator thank you we will take the next question from the line of rakesh kumar from elara capital please go ahead rakesh kumar firstly what is the reason for the drop in the tier1 capital by 60 bps for the consol entity level rakesh kumar but that number is looking like a fall of 50 to 60 bps during the quarter which is slightly on the higher side and the overseas loan book the overseas loan book has increased sequentially in this quarter because of the rupee depreciation rakesh kumar the deposit cost is lower this quarter so would this be only due to the average casa being on the higher side or is there any other reason borrowings have gone up during the current quarter moderator thank you we will take the next question from the line of pranav gupta from aditya birla sun life insurance please go ahead of deposits overall that the overall term deposit growth for the bank is still relatively on the lower side because we kept away from some of the higher cost wholesale deposits as we had other opportunities of refinancing and the borrowings have gone up but again as i said i think in the second half of the year the liquidity would get still tighter and i think banks would need to rely to some extent on the wholesale deposits as well pranav gupta secondly just a data question could you help us with the absolute numbers for ca and sa separately rakesh jha yes it is there in the presentation savings deposits are  207476 billion and current account deposits are  76072 billion agarwal from motilal oswal securities please go ahead what is the level for these assets that we will want to maintain in our portfolio over the coming years happy to grow the portfolio we want to take the coverage been moving the coverage has been increasing at a better pace than that so on provisions you are right that the writebacks can happen and provisions can be lower in a particular quarter but it is very difficult to kind of be sure of when that happens and in the interim there will still be some amount of ageing based provision that will come in as the nonperforming loans move into the deeper buckets on the doubtful and the loss category so that is the reason we are saying that in the second half also the provisions will be elevated so compared to any kind of a normalized credit loss it will definitely be a higher number in the second half of the year as well nitin agarwal can you share the sma2 number if possible compared to the rest of the portfolio moderator thank you we will take the next question from the line of gurpreet arora from quest investment please go ahead ratio has been inching up for last one year so any steps are you taking to shore up deposit growth versus the advances growth third and last question is there any retail loan mix that you have in mind numbers should of course be much closer to 100 basis points kind of a number compared to 300400 basis points where we currently have been running but beyond that for each segment while of course internally we have numbers that we track and monitor the portfolio against we have not separately disclosed that for each of the segments on the creditdeposit ratio you are right that the numbers have increased for us i think it would have increased for almost all the private banks the way we look at this is not just purely from a creditdeposit ratio we also look at the liquidity coverage ratio which we maintain comfortably higher than the minimum requirement of rbi which is 90 we are closer to 110 on that the sme side gurpreet arora is it fair to assume that the 100 basis points credit cost can be achieved over next two years maybe fy2021 migration to ifrs or ind as if that happens it could happen earlier than that presentations back so we still hold on to those targets the interim like we again mentioned in the last call that our focus is to increase the core operating profit for the bank within the risk parameters moderator thank you we will take the next question from the line of akhilesh gupta from reliance nippon life insurance please go ahead making our fcnr deposit competitive in line with currency depreciation market is and what is the allin cost comparable with the domestic market so that is the calibration that we do on a regular basis now depending on the opportunities and the market rates we would see how that fits in in terms of our cost rates in the light of tight liquidity conditions deposit rates we had increased it in september quarter once and we have increased the mclr the lending rate also a couple of times in the last quarter so these rates are calibrated based on the liquidity and competition our expectation as i earlier said is that there would be some increase in these rates in the second half of the year moderator thank you we will take the next question from the line of adarsh parasrampuria from nomura securities please go ahead adarsh parasrampuria a question on liability can you just quantify the retail term deposits as a percentage of our total term deposits for wholesale term deposits what have you seen rates go up by where the wholesale deposit rates are the wholesale deposit rates have really gone up above 8 and then it depends on everyday and every week in terms of where the rate is for the banks we have not separately disclosed the breakup of term deposits into retail and wholesale but a larger proportion of the term deposits would indeed be the retail deposits adarsh parasrampuria it will help if you can quantify it given that it is so sensitive now that the wholesale funds have increased by a larger quantum it will be great if you can just indicate broadly what is the mix would be rakesh jha sure so going forward we would consider doing that so is it not very logical that the nim improvement could end up being pretty sharp over the course of next two to four quarters for casa heavy bank like ours stage that may have an impact on the retail deposit rates as well so it is very difficult to kind of commit on that and given the current liquidity scenario as you see the funding cost will go up i think a sharp increase in margin for the banking system in the next couple of quarters may not be the way it will play out quickly maybe in the third quarter itself if i take a little more longer once rates stabilize say even at levels where we are today once that happens i think it will seep into margins maybe after a couple of quarters right because only like 25 of your funding would be wholesale and rest is retail which is not going up by the same quantum deposits is too high banks may end up increasing the cost of retail deposits so we will have to just see how it plays out margin start maybe next year onwards would you infuse capital if that helps the margins or you have fully written off the bad loans just wanted to understand mathematically as to what the turning point would be there happen within the bank itself but i think more importantly there are nonperforming loans and we are indeed hoping to collect some of them timing is a very difficult thing to estimate there the interest collections from npls are by definition going to be lumpy for example in this quarter we had interest collection on the overseas book and after that the margin is 5 basis points so without that it actually would have meant that interest expense was higher than the interest income just given the level of npls which are there because we have not grown the book in the last two or three years that kind of compounds it more from a margin perspective so as i said as we get into the next financial year hopefully we should see more stability on the margin there premchandani from uti mutual fund please go ahead of nbfc lending opportunities for lending to nbfcs and hfcs and for buying portfolios from them for priority sector purposes or even otherwise so these are options and opportunities that we are looking at all of these of course have to be within our risk appetite so we are open to lending to nbfcs and hfcs and even buying retail portfolios from them relationships which were like going back to two decades and all that how sure you are that similar kind of name lending will not be done in the next credit cycle and i think over time it will show up in the numbers as well amit premchandani but just the approach towards lending to big names and assuming that all will be well because of the names that approach will change permanently for you ma financing that we had done in the past so you are right that in terms of the approach it is going to be more granular and better rated exposure moderator thank you we will take the next question from the line of mayank bukrediwala from goldman sachs please go ahead of that provisioning coming back of provisions for banks including for us as i mentioned earlier there will be further provision that comes in because of ageing of some of these loans based on the rbi guidelines which are there overall it is very difficult to kind of comment on the quantity and timing of the writeback of provisions on the portfolio we are hopeful that we should get reasonable amount of writebacks on some of these loans but we will have to just wait and see when that happens mayank bukrediwala so at an overall level on the entire nclt we do expect writebacks to come in like we expect lgd to certainly be less than 70 frankly within the hands of the bank it is the process under nclt we have seen only one or two resolutions which have happened yet and bulk of the interest has been on sectors like steel and cement and a couple of other names especially in the list2 that rbi had given out to banks there is a lot more of exposure to power sector and some epc companies where the recovery may not be that good so we will have to just see how that plays out through the nclt process mayank bukrediwala just wanted to get a sense on the loss we have recorded on the uk bank subsidiary just some color on that also in terms of asset quality what are the npls in that at the moment have talked about on the domestic and the overseas branches book so that is where we are in terms of the uk portfolio so for the current year we will have to closely monitor that and see how it plays out in terms of the aggregate net npl at the uk subsidiary it was about 190 million as of september 30 2018 moderator thank you we will take the next question from the line of sachin kumar from vashisht capital please go ahead sachin kumar sorry i missed the first 30minutes could you share what is your exposure on the infrastructure company exposure which is there it is a part of the exposure that has got downgraded and it is a part of our overall bb and below portfolio that we disclose moderator thank you we will take the next question from the line of pranav tendulkar from rare enterprises please go ahead because i see that your retail engine has actually started working very well so things like credit score say things like how many common people are there in the retail liability side and asset side are there pricing differentials for various things because those things will be important and those things will matter after sometime our credit cost second what we also do is that all the cases that we are not able to do which do not pass through a filter with a lag of six months or one year if they have taken a loan outside we are able to figure out whether our rejections are proper or improper proper is if the credit cost was higher on that portfolio which we left out i must share that internally we are quite satisfied with what we reject pranav tendulkar sir what is the business banking subvertical in the retail anup bagchi business banking loans are of typical size of  10 to 105 million they are small ticket business loans and all of them are collateralized pranav tendulkar so the collateral will be the property or business cash flows property pranav tendulkar are all these a solebanker relationship anup bagchi yes for  10 million loans there are generally no multiple banks prana v tendulkar because that portfolio is actually growing very fast and it will be very good roe accretive if you can manage the risks anup bagchi yes so far so good moderator thank you we will take the next question from the line of krishnan asv from sbicap securities please go ahead technical writeoffs how soon do you need to get to 100 on your nclt list 1 purely from an ageing provision perspective because bulk of your npas would be residing in the d1 category or beyond d1 category so just a sense of how soon will you need to hit 100 just because of the ageing related provisions 100 so that will be distributed over the next several quarters in terms of the portfolio moving from that 40 provision requirement bucket to 100 provision requirement lot of that would indeed come in the next financial year if we were to continue as per the rbi guidelines and indian gaap rating buckets a broad sense of what you rate aa and above versus what you rate just below that and that is what will be considered under ind as for making the provisions on the stage1 and stage2 category so beyond that i think once we kind of move over to ind as is only when we can give more details on that moderator thank you ladies and gentlemen due to time constraints that was the last question i now hand the conference over to the management for closing comments rakesh jha thank you for your time this evening anindya and i will be available for any further questions that you may

ICICI BANK,highlights the thirdquarter earnings of icici bank strengthens our belief that the bank is well on track on multiple fronts to deliver to targeted returns by june 2020 in fact we will not be surprised if it revises targeted consolidated roe return on equity of 15 percent upwards in another couple of quarters icici bank reported a very healthy performance for q3 fy19 with core preprovision operating profit excluding treasury income  increasing by 14 percent year on year yoy however rise in provisions led to muted headline number of reported net profit declining by 3 percent yoy with bulk of problem assets already recognised till fy18 and in q1 fy19 the slippages or gross additions to nonperforming assets continued to trend downward in q3 however our enthusiasm for the bank is not just limited to receding asset quality problems there is more than a reason that makes us decisively positive on the stock the bank has continued to improve its retail franchise  both assets and liabilities icici banks balance sheet it is now comparable to best in class and is the first reason for our optimism with banks casa low cost current and savings deposits at 49 percent and retail loans at 59 percent of total loan book banks adequate capitalisation is the second reason that makes us affirmative in an environment where large a large part of the lending system has been crippled because of a shortage of capital public sector banks and receding liquidity nbfcs icici bank is well poised to leap ahead with more than adequate capital third and the most important reason is expectation of improvement in return ratios with the receding asset quality issues and provisions thereof we expect the reported numbers to improve significantly from fy20 as the current year fy19 remains a year of consolidation due to higher credit costs and last but not the least considering multiple levers that should help drive sustained improvement in roe banks valuation is extremely attractive with the stock currently trading around 15 times fy20e book current valuations seems to be pricing in the most concerns and offers a favourable risk reward key positives overall advances growth stood at 12 percent yoy as healthy 14 percent growth in domestic loan book was partially negated by 5 percent degrowth in international loans a strong focus on retail lending has enabled icici bank to grow its domestic loan book almost in line with the system growth despite cyclical weakness in the large corporate segment retail assets grew by solid 22 percent yoy while corporate loans were almost flat yoy the net interest margin nim for the quarter improved to 340 percent from 333 in previous quarter mainly due to better margins on international book while margins on the domestic book remained almost stable at 372 percent fee income growth was healthy at 16 percent driven by retail fees which constituted 73 percent of total fees provision coverage ratio pcr improved significantly to 684 percent up 950 bps sequentially this is much faster thanexpected acceleration in banks earlier stated objective to improve pcr to 70 percent by june 2020 gross slippages to nonperforming assets declined in q3 to rs 2091 crore which was very encouraging thanks to contained slippages and higher provisioning net npas declined to 258 percent compared to 365 percent in q2 the banks exposure to list 1 and list 2 of corporates undergoing resolution through national companies law tribunal ncltl declined at rs 3816 crore and rs 8828 crore respectively pcr on the list 1 and 2 was very healthy at 90 percent and 72 percent respectively as at end december increasing the likelihood of write backs in future additionally the banks disclosed pool of loans to corporate and sme rated bb and below potential stress declined to rs 18812 crore equivalent to 33 percent of the loan book which also include the ilfs exposure key negatives casa low cost current and savings accounts ratio dipped marginally to 493 percent as at end december as growth in casa deposits lagged growth in term deposits still overall performance on liability continues to be impressive current stock price factors in known issues valuation rerating to continue in may last year management articulated its strategy to deliver consolidated roe of 15 percent while improving nnpa to 15 percent and maintaining provision cover above 70 percent by june 2020 with its 2020 vision in place investors should expect much lower npa formation and normalised credit cost in fy20 midteen loan growth steady margin and a fast journey to reach roe of 15 percent with a strong capital adequacy tier i capital ratio at 1514 percent we dont see many constraints in delivering its targets with a potential improvement in return rations the current valuation of its core book at 15 times fy20e pbv looks compelling in fact icici bank is trading at significant discount of more than 30 40 percent relative to its closest corporate

ICICI BANK,a section of public sector bankers on thursday raised questions about the rbi seeking powers to regulate stateowned banks saying it apparently failed to act against officials in the icici bank videocon matter despite claiming to have enough powers to deal with private sector lenders against the backdrop of cbi on thursday naming former icici bank chief chanda kochhar and others in the alleged quid pro quo in extending rs 3250crore loan to videocon group some public sector bankers wondered whether the central bank was treating issues at stateowned and private lenders in a different way on condition of anonymity the bankers also claimed that while the rbi has been acting very promptly in penalising top officials of public sector banks even for procedural lapses it appears that the relatively strong case regarding kochhar was not dealt with appropriately in the case of punjab national bank regarding the over rs 14000crore scam by nirav modi the lenders managing director and two executive directors were sacked on grounds of procedural lapses an executive director of a leading public sector bank said there seems to be different approaches by the rbi towards public and private sector banks despite both handling public money the official pointed out while the issue of alleged irregularities in loan extended to videocon group has come under the scanner of multiple authorities including the rbi there has been no direct action taken by the central bank against kochhar before she stepped down last year another senior official of a public sector bank said raising doubts over the intent of the rbi in dealing with private sector lenders an all india bank officers confederation aiboc spokesperson said the central bank did not take any action against icici bank or its officials even after a law firm withdrew its report that had given clean chit to former ceo kochhar after allegations of quid pro quo surfaced in 2016 law firm cyril amarchand mangaldas had given a report regarding the role of kochhar in the matter however the report was withdrawn last year amid a furore over the alleged irregularities in loan given to videocon group kochhar resigned as ceo of icici bank in october 2018 further the aiboc spokesperson raised questions over the rbis differential treatment given to icici bank regarding the loan matter saying the central bank decided to wait for an independent report before taking any action but that was not the case when it came to scams at pnb and bank of maharashtra unlike their public sector counterparts private sector banks do not come under the purview of the central vigilance commission the spokesperson added the all india bank officers confederation aiboc claims to have around 25 lakh members last year former rbi governor urjit patel said while it has far more control over private sector banks it has little say over public sector banks which look up to the finance ministry the weak legal framework over psbs deters the central bank from exercising better control over them he had said patels remarks had came close on the heels of government indicating that regulators were not accountable to anyone,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/psu-bankers-raise-questions-about-delay-in-rbi-action-against-former-icici-bank-chief-chanda-kochhar-3432971.html,1725.2,24-01-2019,1739.65,AKZOINDIA,20:39,psu bankers raise questions about delay in rbi action against former icici bank chief chanda kochhar,moneycontrol

and the commentary from the new management would be a key monitorable it said asset quality to show further improvement slippages to ease but credit costs would be high kotak feels that the unrecognised stress in corporate loans is negligible especially post ilfs crisis as risks emanating from real estate are not too high resolution through the ibc framework has slowed as several high profile cases could not reach a conclusion as anticipated earlier however progress continues outside through settlementsupgradewriteoffs etc in its note kotak says that the governments recent capital

maintained a robust pace of growth at 15 percent yoy compared to 1011 percent in 4qfy18 the pickup in the pace of bank credit has been driven by a sharp spike in retail loans and lending to nbfcs growth in retail loans has been driven by strong uptick in unsecured loans like credit cards and personal loans it said the pace of growth in credit cards has seen a slight dip over the last few months housing loans have seen a modest upward push to 20 percent yoy there has been a slowdown in lending towards secured products like auto and commercial vehicle financing mainly on low growth in the industry demand for commercial vehicles will likely pick pace in 1hfy20e on account of prebuying due to new bsvi norms it added the relative tightening of liquidity is resulting in an increase in

ICICI BANK,as things stand today unlike 2014 there appears a very slim chance of a single party coming to the majority after the general election the market is factoring a coalition led by bjp and that remains the most likely scenario shailendra kumar chief investment officer at narnolia financial advisors said in an interview to moneycontrols sunil shankar matkar edited excerpts q do you expect the nifty to rally 300400 points from here on before elections or is it going to be rangebound amid geopolitical tensions between india and pakistan a nifty is trading in a narrow 5 percent range between 10500 and 11100 for the last four months a decisive breakout beyond this range would require clarity on elections geopolitical situations money market liquidity and earning trajectory for fy20 other global triggers namely economic stress in europe and disappointment during the current earnings season in the us are added issues that market has to factor in before making a decisive move fundamentally there are enough green shoots in terms of rising capacity utilisation and cleaner corporate lending environment that would help the market to climb various walls of worries q considering the current political situation of all parties what are your expectations for general elections a we are in a highly fluid political situation and lots can change to the runup to the election as things stand today unlike 2014 there appears a very slim chance of a single party coming to the majority after the general election the market is factoring a coalition led by bjp and that remains the most likely scenario q how do you read the december quarter earnings season have you changed your estimates for q4 and fy20 a just concluded q3 results were mixed whereas topline growth has remained robust the margin picture has further deteriorated falling margin and subsequent lower net profit growth have surely necessitated a downward revision in earnings estimate for fy19 now we factor 9 percent earnings growth in fy19 but most of the downward margin revisions have been on account of cyclical factors like global commodity prices extra provisioning by corporate lenders and some oneoffs so going forward once these cyclical factors stabilise the margin would recover and earnings growth will be robust in fy20 q what are the major sectors to look at after december quarter earnings season and why a december results have seen continued volume growth particularly on the rural side for fmcg it has shown good growth on the back of better deal wins and rise in digital revenue contribution but the stand out sector had been corporate lenders both on the public and private side advances are showing good growth net interest margin is stabilizing and more important slippage has reduced most of the slippage is from the stressed book and the difference between the stressed asset and gnpa has narrowed also these corporate lenders very prudently have kept their provisioning higher to make their balance sheet strong enough to meet any fresh pocket of nonperforming assets in the coming years q considering positive development between the us and china do you feel trade war will end between both countries soon a after two successful rounds of talks between chinese and us officials the united states is extending the fresh rounds of tariff that was set to be imposed from march 1 also there are indications that the presidents of both nations would be meeting shortly to finally conclude a deal if reforms in china particularly related to intellectual property rights are part of the deal it would be highly beneficial to a balanced global growth with positive impact on emerging economies like india q what are the top five picks to look at for

ICICI BANK,we are recommending icici bank may 9 closing market price rs 382 as a tactical pick icici bank has been a tough stock to crack for investors in the past 10 years the bank faced two asset quality cycles in the last decade the first was a jump in retail bad loans in fy08 coinciding with the global financial crisis and then came a cascade of corporate bad loans the effects of which have been felt since fy13 but the good news is that after a prolonged period of asset quality problems icici bank is now emerging from a lost decade while fy19 was a year of consolidation icici bank will be transitioning from a stressed bank to a growing bank over the next two years and that change will be reflected in its stock performance with bulk of problem assets already recognised till fy18 the slippages or gross additions to nonperforming assets npas trended downward in fy19 however our enthusiasm for the bank is not just limited to receding asset quality problems there is more than a reason that makes us decisively positive on the stock the bank has continued to improve its retail franchise on both assets and liabilities icici banks balance sheet is now comparable to bestinclass and is the first reason for our optimism with the banks casa low cost current and savings accounts at 50 percent and retail loans at 60 percent of total loan book adequate capitalisation is the second reason in an environment where a large part of the lending system has been crippled because of a shortage of capital public sector banks and receding liquidity nbfcs icici bank is well poised to leap ahead with more than adequate capital the third and most important reason for our optimism is a likely improvement in return ratios with bad loans receding provisions too will come down and the reported numbers will improve significantly from fy20 for fy19 credit cost or provisions was 37 percent of average loans and 90 percent of its core operating profit the management has now guided at provisions of 20 percent of core operating profit or about 1213 percent of average advances on a normalised basis and last but not least considering multiple levers that should help drive sustained improvement in its earnings the banks valuation is extremely attractive with the stock currently trading around 14 times fy21 estimated book current valuations offers a high margin of safety and a favourable risk reward play in terms of relative valuation also icici bank is trading at a significant discount to its closest lending peer axis bank in may last year the management articulated its strategy to deliver consolidated return on equity roe of 15 percent while improving net npa to 15 percent and maintaining provision cover above 70 percent by june 2020 with its 2020 vision in place investors should expect much lower npa formation and normalised credit cost in fy20 midteen loan growth steady margin all of which will help the bank achieve an roe of 15 percent rapidly with a strong capital adequacy tier i capital ratio at 1473 percent we dont see many constraints in delivering its targets in short the skies have cleared for icici bank making it an exciting yet relatively safe investment bet follow nehadave01 for more research articles visit our moneycontrol research page,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/weekly-tactical-pick-icici-bank-3953381.html,385.1,10-05-2019,381.4,ICICIBANK,09:04,weekly tactical pick icici bank,moneycontrol

released on july 23 according to brokerage houses estimates the revenue growth could be in the range of 710 percent yoy on the back of around 6 percent volume growth in june quarter despite an expected slowdown in rural demand this along with costsaving measures and operating leverage could boost operating income and profit the volume growth in june quarter last year was 12 percent and in march quarter it was 7 percent considering weak rural demand 6 percent is satisfactory brokerages said lt engineering  infrastructure major larsen  toubro will also declare its quarterly earnings on july 23 which are expected to be good on the back of execution but the order inflow could be muted compared to yearago brokerages feel lt received reasonable order inflows in the range of rs 13000 crore21500 crore which includes more than rs 2500 crore in hydrocarbon more than rs 7000 crore in power over rs 3500 crore in water  effluent treatment segment order intake during the quarter was impacted by slower pace of order awarding during general elections coupled with muted private capex icici direct said the brokerage further said lts order backlog suggests better execution rate in the domestic market in q1fy20e and fy20 consequently it expects the companys standalone revenue to grow 102 percent ebitda to grow 135 percent with margin expansion kotak too expects 10 percent growth in core epc execution in q1fy20 driven by infrastructure segment 11 percent defence engineering and heavy engineering but it said power ea and others segments could drag down revenue growth tata motors and maruti suzuki the auto sector is expected to report weak earnings for another quarter in q1fy20 due to decline in volume amid subdued demand tight liquidity rising buying cost and pollution norms hence the sharp fall in vehicle sales is expected to reflect in all parameters from topline to bottomline levels brokerages feel nifty auto index fell nearly 5 percent against 15 percent increase in nifty50 tata motors was down 67 percent and maruti suzuki 2 percent during the quarter according to brokerages tata motors is likely to report a loss of more than rs 1200 crore in june quarter 2019 and around 16 percent decline in consolidated revenue due to 22 percent fall in standalone domestic volumes and around 16 percent dip in jlr volumes yoy key issues to watch out for would be current demand trends for jlr and outlook for key markets update on costcutting initiatives at jlr demand trend in domestic markets and new product launch and impact of forex hedge loss in the case of maruti suzuki brokerages expect doubledigit decline across parameters due to 18 percent yoy degrowth in volumes revenues are expected to decline by 14 percent yoy in q1fy20 which will be offset by 4 percent yoy increase in asps due to an increase in costs owing to new safety regulations kotak said kotak further expects ebitda to decline by 42 percent yoy in q1fy20 led by rise in commodity costs negative operating leverage and high fixed costs in the gujarat plant due to low volumes icici bank the countrys largest private sector lender is expected to report strong profits in june quarter with improvement in asset quality on july 27 the loan book as well as nii both may grow doubledigits yoy but net interest margin may contract a bit sequentially due to increasing funding cost we expect core earnings base quarter had stake sale gains of icici life trajectory to remain strong at around 15 percent yoy led by healthy loan growth around 15 percent yoy and better nii growth 19 percent yoy nim will decline qoq by around 10bps due to lower oneoffs said kotak which expects profit at rs 13931 crore against loss of rs 1196 crore in q1fy19 the brokerage expects reduction in gross npls on the back of writeoffs credit costs will decline qoq led by lower slippages around below 17 percent of loans primarily from agriculture below investment grade portfolio would decline qoq and coverage ratio would improve qoq it said key things to watch out for would be outlook on asset quality and trend on further relapse from restructured loans and growth in casa  retail term deposits fiis  diis fiis sold around rs 3000 crore worth of shares during last week taking total net july outflow to around rs 8000 crore thanks to finance minister putting surchage on superrich in budget and concerns over consumption slowdown along with asset quality headwinds this was against consistent buying worth rs 79000 crore in previous five consecutive months as per data available on moneycontrol on the other hand domestic institutional investors remained net buyers to the tune of around rs 6500 crore lending major support to the market hence going forward the key thing to watch out for would be any revival in fii flow which could be possible only if federal reserve cut interest rate in coming policy meetings to support us economic growth and if june quarter earnings season hints at a major recovery in coming quarters or any major policy change to boost consumptiongrowth technical outlook the nifty50 has broken crucial support levels of 11600 and 11500 on closing basis and even 11400 intraday in the week gone by and formed bearish candle on the weekly scale with the nifty correcting sharply the bears seem to be in control and the sentiments are so bearish that the index could break 11300 levels though there is a possibility of relief rally initially in the coming week experts feel the weekly price action for nifty resulted in a sizable bear candle with lower high and lower low signalling continuation of negative bias breach of key rising trend line placed at 11530 and lack of faster retracement of preceding declining legs makes us believe that nifty is heading towards 11300 levels while stockspecific action would continue as we sail through q1fy20 earnings and derivatives expiry of july 2019 series dharmesh shah head  technical at icici direct told moneycontrol he said for the first time since october 2018 the index has retraced its preceding major rally by more than 618 percent indicating extended consolidation going ahead this development coupled with the shallow nature of pullbacks led him to believe that 1160011650 will act as key hurdle going forward as it is the low of exit poll session and recent breakdown area fo expiry on the option front maximum put open interest oi is at 11300 followed by 11400 strike which could act as support levels in near term while maximum call oi is at 11600 followed by 11700 strike which could be resistance levels we have seen put writing at 11400 and 11350 strike while meaningful call writing is at 11500 followed by 11600 strike hence a major shift in oi concentration suggests a shift in lower trading range in between 11300 to 1160011700 zones and which could also be a range for coming fo expiry week experts feel the nifty succumbed to fii selling pressure and declined from the highest call base of 11700 which remains a shortterm hurdle for the market on intermediate pullbacks the index is heading towards 11300 put strike which gained open interest since the budget day amit gupta of icici direct said nifty future premium has reduced in the last couple of weeks this translates into current profit booking trend in the market it may still take some time for the index to start getting the

ICICI BANK,reserve bank of india rbi on june 7 issued a revised circular on the resolution of stressed assets which most experts feel will bring much more clarity to the process they also think it is a definite winwin for both lenders as well as the borrower rbi has said that lenders must resolve nonperforming assets npa over rs 2000 crore within 180 days the latest directions from the rbi retains the basic spirit of february 12 2018 circular as it mandates higher provisioning bankruptcy options and not allowing any other resolution methods outside the new norms a pti report said the new norms provide a framework for early recognition reporting and timebound resolution of stressed assets the central bank said in a notification on june 7 in the revised norms on stressed assets rbi has said that in case of a default by a borrower lenders have to undertake a prima facie review of the borrower account within 30 days from such default called the review period this is a welcome step since there was a lag between noticing the default and then having a resolution to it earlier it was mandated to identify it on day 1 which was actually a losing situation for the borrower this was actually creating a stressful situation for the lender and the borrower mustafa nadeem ceo epic research told moneycontrol this new 30day window will now actually put a cushion for the borrower secondly the powers that have been now given to lender brings a lot of clarity on the table since it will now be able to identify the bad loans study the books and make a concrete resolution for the same he said nadeem further added that it is a winwin situation for boththe lender and the borroweras it brings logically muchneeded clarity during this review period of 30 days lenders may decide on the resolution strategy including the nature of the resolution plan and how it will be implemented the lenders can also choose to initiate legal proceedings for insolvency or recovery in cases where a resolution plan is to be implemented all lenders have to enter into an intercreditor agreement ica during the abovesaid review period also read  rbi revises npa norms gives banks 30 days to review stressed loans even though the revised framework for resolution of stressed assets does away with the implementation of resolution plan for borrowers overdue by up to 30 days the overall framework is positive and will continue to incentivise banks for accelerated resolution of stressed assets karthik srinivasan group head financial sector ratings at icra said further incentives to reverse 50 percent of these provisions upon reference under ibc will incentivise lenders to refer such stressed cases to ibc for faster resolution however lenders may adopt a casespecific approach for such reference he said srinivasan further added that even though criterion for upgradation of stressed account has been relaxed which now requires at least 10 percent of debt repayments at the time of restructuring from 20 percent earlier the requirement of an investment grade ratings by the external agency will ensure that upgradation is done only for viable cases heres how brokerage firms reacted on the rbi circular clsa the rbi offers leeway to banks and the onus of resolutions is now on them the new framework addresses banks concerns by giving four concessions there is no rulebased reference to nclt the central bank gave an extra 30 days ie a total of 210 days for implementing resolution plans it will be a tad easier for norms for loan upgrades the new norms may address the risk of nclt references to rs 152 lakh crore of loans we prefer private corporate banks like icici bank  indusind bank  and among psus it prefers sbi  deutsche bank the new npa norms are likely to provide flexibility in the resolution process we expect some pickup in the pace of resolution overall it is positive for banks it could provide some relief to power companies the new norms should help in expediting resolution for power sector lending nomura most changes to the resolution process for stressed assets are practical the changes rightly incentivise banks to find a timebound resolution rbi has mandated additional provisions of 2035 percent if lenders do not find a resolution plan the resolution would need a nod of 75 percent of lenders by value or 60 percent by the number of lenders the revised framework eliminates the stringent rule of oneday default we prefer corporate banks as the credit cycle is peaking for larger corporate banks the corporate banks have limited exposure to recently stressed names in nbfcinfra space,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rbi-npa-norms-market-reaction-4077781.html,416.1,10-06-2019,416.6,ICICIBANK,10:32,rbi revises npa norms a winwin situation for lenders  borrowers,moneycontrol

PI INDUSTRIES,it was yet another week of consolidation for our markets in the absence of major triggers the index started off well with some hope of surpassing the stiff hurdle of 12000 but once again the attempt turned unsuccessful during the remaining part of last week the index kept oscillating around the lower end of the range to eventually conclude a tad above the 11800 mark although the markets consolidated last week the overall bias remained on the negative side and hence any intraweek pull back was getting sold into now with this price development we can see the trading range getting shrunk further whenever this happens we will get a breakout on either side from the congestion zone on the lower side 11769 is the level to watch out for any sustainable move below this could trigger a selloff and the index is likely to head towards 1160011550 levels however looking at the broader picture we are still hopeful and expect the market to break out in the upward direction on the higher side 1195012000 has become a sturdy wall at this juncture the pragmatic strategy would be to stay light and wait for a breakout from the mentioned range to create aggressive positions meanwhile keep focusing on individual stocks that are providing better trading opportunities here is a list of two stocks that could offer 710 percent return in the next 1421 sessions pi industries  buy target rs 117005 target rs 1250 stop loss rs 1128 upside 7 despite the overall broader market destruction this stock has been maintaining its sturdy structure for a long time on friday this stock bucked the trend and in the process managed to give yet another breakout to clock fresh record highs if we look at the volume activity it has risen substantially providing credence to the price development we expect this outperformance to continue and fresh leg of the rally to unfold in days to come thus we recommend buying at current level for the target of rs 1250 and a stop loss should be fixed at rs 1128 wockhardt  buy ltp rs 38725 target rs 424 stop loss rs 373 upside 10 the entire pharmaceutical space has been undergoing a difficult period and there has been no respite even after underperforming for nearly four years now the nifty pharma index is trading at its multiyear lows and on friday we saw some signs of near term bounce some of the larger peers rebounded sharply to provide some ray of hope for this beaten down sector we like wockpharma because it has been making valiant efforts to surpass its hurdle of rs 400 which would unfold a strong upward rally but before this we have been witnessing some buying at lower levels and hence with an anticipation of a breakout we recommend buying at current levels for a target of rs 424 and the stop loss should be fixed at rs 372 the author is chief analyst technical  derivatives angel broking,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/podcast-stock-picks-of-the-day-market-lacking-clear-direction-wait-for-a-breakout-4103231.html,1169.85,17-06-2019,1170.05,PIIND,08:36,podcast  stock picks of the day market lacking clear direction wait for a breakout,moneycontrol
PI INDUSTRIES,performance of companies in the agrochemical space remained largely mixed in q3fy19 few companies like pi industries  upl  sharda cropchem and insecticides india started showing green shoots with improved performance however others such as dhanuka agritech  rallis india and coromandel international continued to be hit by global raw material supply shortage and weak domestic demand of the agrochemical stocks we find pi industries and insecticides india on track for growth and would recommend to keep these on radar and accumulate for long term portfolio in a staggered manner key industry trends domestic market growth remains muted  performance in the domestic market remained largely muted the rabi acreages were down due to deficit northeast monsoon and low soil moisture content despite a normal monsoon and a healthy crop production in the preceding kharif season crop yields remained low due to lower than msp minimum support price sale price of produce this resulted in a stressed cash situation with farmers impacting domestic volumes while the domestic demand growth remained muted the export segment of companies showed growth high raw material costs  margins of most companies continued to be impacted due to high raw material costs since 2017 a large number of chinese agrochemical manufacturers were driven out due to stricter environmental norms which resulted in raw material shortage thereby pushing up prices and impacting margins price hikes remained limited due to high inventory in channels and stressed competitive landscape however most management indicated there has been a relative easing in the supply situation with new suppliers coming in different parts of the world backward integration  companies such as rallis india tata chemicals insecticides india etc have also taken steps towards backward integration in order to reduce supply anomalies bring cost savings and take advantage of the scarcity situation improvement in the supply situation should be positive for the margins of the companies new product launches  banning of 20 chemicals in 2018 that kicks off in 2020 resulted in an expectation of reduced volumes for companies with exposure to these products however most companies are working towards greener chemistry and have a healthy lineup of product launches in the upcoming year products launched in 2018 have also seen a good response government initiatives  there has been a lot of focus from the policy front in order to support the farm sector and improve farm incomes while on paper the new policies favour the overall development of the industry a lot of it would be dependent on the grass root implementation implementation of the msps remained weak in the kharif season strong implementation stands to benefit the sector stocks pi industries  strong q3 with healthy growth in topline and margins the product pipeline is rich along with a strong order book and a debt free balance sheet the export business has seen a strong upsurge and we expect this to continue insecticides india  encouraging growth in q3 a healthy line up of new products to offset the impact of molecule ban three of the companys molecules around 15 percent of topline in the ban list high demand for banned products to benefit near term volumes backward integration to smoothen input costs and supplies and strategic shift to high margin branded products to improve margins upl  healthy q3 results though the net margins were impacted due to one off exceptional expenses while the synergies related to the arysta deal will start benefitting the performance after 23 years we see expenses and higher leveraging to impact margins in the near term substantial exposure in various geographies increases the weather and currency related risks sharda cropchem  noncore belts division drove a healthy q3 operating and net profits too reported a strong improvement on a consolidated basis china supply disruption has been a major overhang on the stock though there is an expectation of some relief on that front we believe it would take time before it normalizes dhanuka agritech  q3 performance was disappointing with margin contraction new launches price hikes and branded portfolio to drive growth in future asset light model facilitates concentration on brand development more than half of its sales come from speciality molecules with higher margins low penetration of herbicides and fungicides in india augurs well for the companys growth rallis  performance continues to be impacted due to high input costs speciality products with higher profitability should help improve margins announcement of capex which was not there since past 34 years suggest that the group might turn around from the current mess in the long term however the company is currently impacted by the external operating environment and we believe the overhang would continue in the near term coromandel international  disappointing performance with margin contraction owing to increased input costs and inability to take sufficient price hikes though we expect the pressure on margins to continue in the short term we expect improved growth in the long period owing to the growing share of the nonsubsidy business greater operating leverage and visibility of growth in the crop protection business outlook after a period of an adverse operating environment the industry situation seems to be stabilising a bit now with projections of a normal southwest monsoon in 2019 we expect the performance of the sector companies to improve with clearer inventory channels companies are better positioned to take price hikes to a certain extent the overall policy environment is also favourable for the sector and improved farm

TATA STEEL,the european commission has blocked the proposed joint venture between tata steel and germanys thyssenkrupp dealing a serious blow to the indian steelmakers plans to stabilise its operations in europe the jv which was signed last year would have merged the european operations of the two companies making it the second biggest in the continent after arcelromittal tata steels european operations  including units in the uk and netherlands  had come under its fold after the acquisition of corus in 2007 the operations especially the uk units had been hit by high costs and accentuated by a soft market in europe that never recovered fully after the financial slowdown of 2008 the jv an equal partnership between the two was expected to turnaround the operations but it was not to be the commission was probing the jv checking if the venture will hurt competition in some of the key segments of the steel sector in europe the commission had identified three industry segments  automotive steel coated steel used for packaging and electrical steel  where the jv may harm competition feedback from the commission based on the market test it has undertaken suggests that it is unlikely to clear the proposal in spite of the significant remedies offered consequently the partners assume with deep disappointment that the european commission will not approve the joint venture tata steel said in a statement on friday tata steel and thyssenkrupp are believed to have offered to sell plants in spain belgium and the uk the uk facilities could include units that make electrical steel and packing steel the two partners had submitted a proposal that includes concessions and the commission was expected to come to a decision by june 17 but with further remedies coming from the two partners the commission gave its feedback much before the deadline in the view of thyssenkrupp and tata steel further commitments or improvements to the remedy package would adversely affect the basic foundation of the proposed joint venture and the intended synergies arising from the merger to such an extent that the economic logic of the joint venture would no longer be valid hence both partners are unable to offer any further remedies to the commission to meet its requirements tata steel said the jv would have had annual revenues of 17 billion euros and produce 21 million tons of steel a year way forward the proposed joint venture was an important strategic initiative for tata steel it would have helped the company deconsolidate the european business and deleverage its balance sheet there are a few options to explore said tv narendran tata steel ceo  md while addressing a media call just after the announcement while he declined to elaborate narendran said the focus will be to keep the operations sustainable he reiterated that the european operations needed to be cash positive which they werent last year but the company expects the european operations to perform better with a five percent increase in volumes last year the operations were hampered because of a shutdown in the blast furnace said narendran executive director and cfo koushik chatterjee added that the company is disappointed that the jv didnt happen but is keeping all the options open statement from thyssenkrupp with the expected unsuccessful outcome of the steel joint venture the executive board of thyssenkrupp ag has reassessed the strategic options for the company and will propose to the supervisory board to not go ahead with the planned separation into two independent companies,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/european-commission-blocks-tata-steels-jv-with-thyssenkrupp-3958501.html,486.8,10-05-2019,519.15,TATASTEEL,20:39,european commission blocks tata steels jv with thyssenkrupp,moneycontrol

TATA STEEL,when paresh shah bought shares of tata steel  he had done so with a lot of conviction that the stock would eventually move up however after six months he found that despite all the pep talk from his broker and the rosy picture painted by analysts the stock was still trading below his purchase price what is more concerning is the fact that the stock was not even showing signs of momentum what can paresh do at this point in time frankly that is not too complicated tata steel represents a solid business from a reputed business group and has rewarded investors in the past paresh himself is convinced that the stock is a good investment and is willing to wait but waiting has a cost and that cost is in the form of lost opportunities can paresh make his investment productive in such a way that he at least earns some money even as he holds the stock of tata steel the answer could be a covered call but what exactly is a covered call strategy a covered call is a simple hybrid strategy of selling higher call options when you buy a call you get a right to buy without the obligation but when you sell a call you get the obligation to sell the stock without the right let us now get back to our illustration on tata steel paresh had bought tata steel at a price of rs 530 currently the stock is quoting at lets say rs 502 while it is a notional loss his funds have been locked up in tata steel for the last six months that is where a covered call would have helped in a covered call the investor holds on to the cash position in tata steel but keeps selling higher strike call options this is how a covered call strategy will look like when the spot price is rs 502 cash market trade call option trade buy tata steel 1061 shares at rs 530 sell 1 lot 530 strike call at rs 950 now there are three possible price outcomes in the above case  if the stock price remains below rs 530 then the entire option premium of rs 950 will come into pareshs account and reduce his cost of tata steel to rs 52050  if the stock price goes sharply lower then paresh still earns the premium of rs 950 but the notional loss on tata steel widens that is not a comfortable situation  if the stock price goes up to rs 560 then there is a loss on the short call but since he is long on the cash market position he has nothing much to really worry about using covered call to consistently reduce your cost of holding the stock in fact this is where the real power of a covered call is realised if the view is that tata steel will not breach above the rs 530 mark then each month paresh can earn the premium by selling the higher call since the option expires on the last thursday of the month each month he will have to write a fresh short call does that mean each month he will make a profit on the call not exactly in some months the price movement may not favour and paresh will have to book a loss let us look at a practical scenario of how this strategy will work over a period of six months where some months are good and some are bad the table below captures how the covered call would have panned out in the last 6 months by consistently selling higher calls for six months paresh would have made rs 1725 as net profit on selling calls that effectively reduces his cost of holding tata steel from rs 530 to rs 51275 at the current market price of rs 502 your mtm loss now looks a lot more justifiable that is the advantage that you get from a covered call strategy two very important precautions needed in a covered call while a covered call is a great strategy to reduce your cost and put your investment to work there are two important things that you need to keep in mind a some traders buy futures on the stock instead of a cash market position the risk is that if the stock price falls sharply then your call has limited profit but your mtm losses on the futures can mount b at no point should this strategy be closed as a single leg for example if the price goes up dont book profits on the cash market position and hold the short call you are not hedged and your losses can mount rapidly covered calls are simple to use and easy to understand in a volatile market like india these covered calls can be a good bet at least on predictable stocks with inherent strengths the author is chief analyst  technical  derivatives  angel broking,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/covered-calls-reduce-cost-holding-stock-4083801.html,492.5,11-06-2019,486.05,TATASTEEL,12:40,heres how to use covered calls to reduce cost of holding a stock,moneycontrol

TATA STEEL,it was not a start that a managing director would wish for but tv narendran had no choice the first crisis hit within two weeks of him taking over at the helm of tata steels india and south east asia businesses in november 2013 there was a huge explosion in jamshedpur the companys iconic steelmaking facility it was a heavy dent on a company that prided on its safety record and employee welfare as narendran said it was a huge issue and had never happened the crisis was just one of the many that were to come a little over a year later the government passed the mines and minerals development and regulation act which temporarily closed down mines of tata steel the company was forced to import iron ore again a first for the steelmaker just when things were getting back to normal and tata steel got to reopen the mines china  the worlds largest steelmaker and consumer  went into a tailspin in 2015 within six months steel prices went to the levels of 2003 recalls the tata steel chief if the start was not great the end of his first fiveyear tenure was marked by another serious setback the proposed joint venture with thyssenkrupp which would have merged the european businesses of the two companies couldnt clear the regulatory hurdle  it was called off earlier this year sometimes things work your way sometimes they dont one has to keep chin up and move on narendran told moneycontrol in a recent interview in mumbai we never like to waste a crisis we want to become stronger coming out of a crisis he added chin up he did over these five years and despite the many setbacks tata steel has become a leaner company by expanding its india business and shedding much of the weight of its european operations from 18 million tons the european unit now makes 10 million tons of steel the uk facility a bigger part of the challenge now manufactures 3 million tons a year down from the earlier 11 million tons the rest comes from the more profitable netherlandsbased unit today we are seen as a very serious player in europes auto industry which was not our reputation a few years back in fact the jv with thyssenkrupp may have been cleared if we hadnt been such a strong player said narendran one of the objections raised by the european commission which was investigating the jv was over the monopolistic position of the venture in europes auto sector in india the annual capacity has grown to 18 million tons over the five years especially thanks to the acquisition of usha martin and bhushan steel equally important was the commissioning of the kalinganagar facility  which was in the works for over a decade  in 2016 the achievements were noticed and narendran  who tata group insiders said has the backing of chairman n chandrasekaran  was elevated as global ceo  managing director of tata steel in 2017 his second tenure comes up for shareholders approval in the upcoming agm on july 19 the unlikely candidate narendrans appointment as the tata steel md was a surprise for many in the industry not because he lacked the qualifications after completing his engineering from national institute of technology tiruchirappalli and mba from iim calcutta narendran joined tata steel in 1988 as a trainee but while his predecessors were operations guys narendran was seen as a marketing veteran who had spent considerable years outside india just before taking the top job he was heading the south east asia business the choice though has helped refocus the company to produce more of what can be sold profitably in some of the segments it now operates like a consumer durables company  bringing in higher margins personally too narendran has eased into the role even as he shuttles between jamshedpur mumbai and europe the 54yearold manages to keep aside time for himself a 5amriser narendran goes for 10k runs  am not chandra the chairman who is a known marathoner he clarified with a chuckle in jamshedpur the wicketkeeperturned all rounderturned batsman my arms dont let me bowl anymore manages to squeeze in an innings or two what he misses most is his labrador zoey whom he prefers to keep in jamshedpur a flat in mumbai would be too constraining for her irrespective of the location though narendran has managed to continue some of his most passionate initiatives including the informal meetings with companys young executives it was a practice he started in singapore where he was heading the south east asia business as you become more senior you get disconnected from people on the ground and these are not people you would see regularly in meetings said narendran it helped in several ways one he was able to engage young professionals below 30 years who have been most prone to leave the company our attrition rates are highest with people who have spent less than five years in the company said the global md  ceo second these conversations sparked new ideas while the companys lgbt policy was developed and framed after one such meeting another gathering highlighted the need for a further and wider cultural change once i had a group breakfast meeting with the youngsters and one of them asked me pioneering is one of our values but all the pioneering stuff you are talking about was done 100 years ago what is the pioneering stuff that you are doing now it was a very valid question recounted narendran the next five and that is what narendran wants to do in the next five years of his tenure as tata steels global md  ceo to me the last five years have been about dealing with the challenges and also dealing with the structural strength of tata steel that ball is rolling and will continue to roll the next five years is more about cultural issues and new businesses he said among the new business tata steel has ventured into scrap recycling  a first for a major steelmaker in india these are to me seeds that we are planting for the future says narendran about the project that he accepts is close to his heart the new vertical called new materials business will also manufacture fibre reinforced polymer that are used in auto and infrastructure sectors another big initiative is to make tata steel among the top 5 in the world in rd we have a team working on that he said of the transformation project that will take at least five years if you see south korean steelmaker posco they were nobody in technology but today they are one of the leaders overall he wants tata steel to be agile a difficult task otherwise for an organisation that is as colossal as the steel company tata steel is a battleship you cant drive it like a power boat but at the same time the world is becoming more volatile so you need to be agile so to me these are the changes that we want to drive in tata steel

1011 and avanse financial services to warburg pincus dhfl is expected to pay the dues after june 11 now promoters hold 3721 percent stake in the company they are already in talks with some major

DEWAN HOUSING,the fact that bonds come with risk perhaps lower than equities but even so is now dawning upon us at least the actions of some of the investors in nonconvertible debentures ncd of some nonbanking finance companies nbfc indicate so some of these ncds are quoting at discount to their issue price in the secondary market for example dewan housing finance ncd offering 925 percent rate of interest till maturity in september 2023 quotes at rs 715 as against the issue price of rs 1000 though some experts reckon this as overreaction by investors but what are the lessons for the investors the problems with nbfc bond instruments have been around for the last few months the asset liability mismatch is the chief culprit behind this nbfcs have raised shortterm money by way of commercial papers and shortterm loans from banks to lend for longterm which includes home loans once the shortterm funding stops the nbfcs are squeezed on the one hand they have to repay the shortterm loans and commercial papers and on the other their customers pay as per the repayment schedule over an extended period of time to worsen the situation the market forces tighten the liquidity situation either these nbfcs do not get fresh money or they get it at a significantly higher price ie higher interest rates since these nbfcs cant reprice their already given loans beyond a point but see their cost of funds going up their profitability is expected to go for a toss if this continues for long period of time which further shoo away investors while the future is uncertain some of the existing investors are trying to escape by selling their ncds at whatever price they get some retail investors are overreacting to the issues faced by nbfcs and exiting the ncds at whatever price they get on the exchange there are asset liability mismatch and other problems but investors should not panic says ajay manglunia head of fixed income edelweiss financial services it is time to stay put and let clarity emerge he points out that yields in the retail markets are quoting at a far higher level than the yield quoting at the institutional level in case of some bonds this speaks for overreaction by retail investors dhfl ncds are quoting at 17 percent yield on the exchanges but after the news of crisis hit the markets dhfl managed to raise money at 10 percent to 1025 percent also the asset sale has happened at yields closer to this level here are some examples of bonds quoting at high yield in the secondary market source synergee capital note this is neither an exhaustive list of bonds nor are investment recommendations the uncertain environment has led investors to two questions  what should they be doing with their existing investments in these ncds and what should be the learnings from these investments most fixed income experts say that you do not have many choices if you are an existing investor in these bonds the yields at which some of these bonds quote at the moment are absurd nothing can be done just hold on to the investments says joydeep sen founder of mumbaibased wealth management firm wiseinvestorin if you sell now you book losses as you sell at a steep discount to the issue price there are companies such as dhfl where the promoters have been honouring all their repayments so far and if they manage to raise funds the way they were doing in the past there is a fair chance that the existing investors in ncds will be paid he points out in a note that axis asset management circulated among its distributors and advisors dated 31 january on its own investments in dhfl it said that despite the liquidity crunch after september 21 2018 the company has repaid loans of rs 17876 crore primarily funding the same through portfolio selldown papers across issuers may see different outcomes as the situation unfolds further though existing investors cant do much there are a few lessons for investors in future investors have woken up to a harsh reality in the last six months the safe haven called fixed income investing has emerged as a minefield investors have looked at debt as a lowrisk investment option but they must understand the risk involved when they look for 2 to 3 percentage points more on bonds as compared to riskfree bonds if you do not understand the business risk do not venture out for higher yields says ajay manglunia many investors are comfortable with a 10 percent or 20 percent fall in the prices of the shares they hold the price erosion is a part of equity investing for them but the same investors find it difficult to digest even 5 percent fall in the bond prices fixed income instruments may aim to give you regular income but not all come at a negligible risk like a fixed deposit one fixedincome instrument could be riskier than the other the problem compounds when aaa rated or aa rated instruments delays or defaults on their interest payment commitments investors must do their homework before investing you cant rely on the credit rating issued by credit rating agencies if you do not understand the business and cannot arrive at an informed decision then just stay out says vinod jain founder and chief financial planner of jain investment planners jain says that the time has come for a change in the ways rating agencies give credit rating to investors make investors pay for credit rating than the extant arrangement of issuer paying for credit rating investors who understand the credit markets or have access to expert advice may actually end up taking informed decision going forward however most of the retail investors who lack the time and expertise to analyse the bond offering would find it difficult to invest going forward in such circumstances the investors would be better off investing in a diversified basket since most small investors lack the skillset or lack the time to analyse it is better to invest in minimum 10 names more the better no single issuer should get more than 10 percent of the investible sum says joydeep sen retail investors should invest in the top notch names such as hdfc  lic housing finance or the bonds issued by central government undertakings since there is a little credit risk says vikram dalal founder and managing director of synergee capital services investors from low income tax slabs can look for opportunities in fixed deposits there are some opportunities to earn some extra money without taking much risk for example hdfc limited the housing finance company offers 819 percent returns for a deposit maturing in 33 months whereas hdfc bank offers 74 percent for a fixed deposit of three years term similar is the case if you are looking for government backed investments state bank of india five year fixed deposit offers 685 percent rate of interest whereas india post offers 8 percent rate of interest on national saving certificate maturing in five

companies according to data from morningstar kotak mahindra amc told moneycontrol that while all the remaining assets of kotak fmp series 127 have been sold and the cash paid to its investors just two companies  edisons utility works pvt ltd and konti infrapower and multiventures pvt ltd both are essel group companies  havent yet paid them back these borrowers had requested for an extension of time to repay their dues back in january 2019 lenders including nonbanking finance companies and mutual funds had come to a joint agreement that they will give time to the essel group companies till around september 2019 to repay their dues kotak fmp series 127 investors as well as those of other fmps that are about to mature and which had invested in such troubled scrips will have to wait with bated breath to get the remaining portion of the money back other fund houses fmps coming up for maturity in the next two months that had invested in essel group companies too are expected to either give the remaining money back to their investors and hope to pay the rest after recovery or roll over the fmps for another year december 2018 portfolios show that fund houses had parked rs 8002 crore in debt securities of essel group companies of this rs 1673 crore was held by fmps kotak amcs fmps held around rs 381 crore and the rest by openended schemes as per morningstar india data a total of six fund houses had fmps that invested in securities issued by essel group companies hdfc asset management co ltd which had rs 902 crore invested in essel group companies debt securities across all its fmps has told moneycontrol that it has chosen to roll overextend the maturity of hdfc fmp 1168d feb 2016 1 a plan under hdfc fixed maturity plans series 35 due for maturity on monday april 15 2019 the rolled over scheme will now mature on april 29 2020 if a majority of its investors agree to roll over the purpose of rollover extension is due to current interest rate scenario and portfolio positioning the yields prevailing in the short maturity bucket present an option for investors to lockin their investments at current prevailing yields its emailed statement said flashback since august 2018 debt mutual funds have been found investing in securities that have faced several headwinds around augustseptember 2018 infrastructure leasing  financial services ltd ilfs and a few of its subsidiaries debt instruments were downgraded on the back of weak financials and default in payment of interest and repayment of principal a total of about 33 funds across liquid ultra shortterm bond funds shortterm bond funds credit risk funds etc had these companies in their portfolios at that time the cumulative value of the holdings in these funds added up to rs 2308 crore as at endaugust 2018 according to data from crisil soon after dewan housing finance corporations dhfl share price fell a hike in its borrowing rates following the liquidity crunch after the ilfs crisis coupled by allegations of siphoning off funds made by an online investigative portal spelt bad news for the group and debt funds that had lent to it dhfl too was downgraded the zee problem on 25 january shares of zee entertainment enterprises zeel fell 26 percent and those of dish tv india fell nearly 33 percent here mutual funds had invested in debt securities issued by some essel group companies this particular lending agreement was secured by equity shares of zeel and dish tv so that if the value of shares fall below the agreed limit lenders such as mutual funds have a right to sell the shares and take their money back or force the borrower to pledge more shares as guarantee but when a few lenders went ahead and sold the shares because they must have thought a possible default was imminent the share prices collapsed as per the agreement mutual funds were supposed to either sell the shares or force essel group promoters to pledge more shares to ensure that the cover remains at the original agreed limit but neither of this happened instead the essel group management reached an agreement with other lenders including mutual funds to get time till around september 2019 to arrange for funds meanwhile closedend funds such as fmps that have either just matured or are coming up for maturity in the next two months are in a bit of a soup as and when they recover their money from the essel group of companies they will pay it back to investors those ilfs securities where recovery is uncertain have been provided for fund houses have written them off in the meantime thats a loss on the other hand fund houses are still holding out a glimmer of hope that essel group companies will pay up back in january as far as essel group debt securities are concerned fund houses had no choice there were 44 lenders at the time that had collectively lent rs 13500 crore according to what was heard on the street at the time four lenders that had lent around rs 200 core collectively were known to have sold the zee group shares around 25 january that led to the share price collapse zeels share price closed at rs 31935 on 25 january down from rs 43410 a day before and dish tvs share price closed at rs 226 down from rs 3360 a day before if just four lenders could cause such havoc we can only imagine what would have happened to the stock had all 44 lenders that had collectively lent rs 13500 crore dumped their zee group pledged shares why not mark down the security but heres the tricky part kotak amc and we hear other fund houses are set to do the same has not marked down the security the fund houses reiterated that they have valued the securities as per the valuations that the two rating agencies crisil ltd and icra ltd provide on a daily basis to all fund houses ideally when a security defaults which the two essel group companies did or merely postponed payment depending on how youd like to look at it  the fund houses are supposed to mark down the security and the net asset value shows a loss here kotak amc tells us that the affected fund houses voluntarily gave an extension to the essel group up to around september 2019 to come up with the money hence this is not a default fund houses say this means on paper investors have not suffered a loss theyve just got a part most actually of their payment now from all the other assets that the fmp sold off and the remaining payment will come as soon as the fund houses recover the dues more so because the fund houses say they are confident of the sale of essel group assets and recovery of their own dues but is that the right thing to do to dissuade us from telling lies our parents used to teach us that it takes a thousand lies to hide one lie because you have to tell two lies to protect one then four lies to protect the two and so ontill it becomes unmanageable the fund industrys mess reminds us of this it was bad enough that they decided to take undue risks then the situation got out of their hands when they couldnt sell the pledged shares too many shares had got pledged by then so asking for more cover was not a viable option if they sold the shares they already had and the share prices would have collapsed with very little room left to manoeuver they had to give an extension will mutual funds get their money back only time will tell the essel group may have good brands so there could still be hope of recovering money but things could go either way mutual funds have to go back to their drawing board and assess how much risk they ought to take meanwhile fund managers who stayed away from taking credit risks and lost out to many of their aggressive peers in recent years are now having the last laugh,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/opinion-the-risk-in-fixed-maturity-plans-is-now-out-in-the-open-3801541.html,172.65,11-04-2019,167.65,DHFL,08:49,opinion  the risk in fixed maturity

WIPRO,finally the bulls lost their control over dalal street for the first time in the last eight consecutive weeks driven by profit booking amid monsoon concerns and caution as voting for general elections started and q4 earnings season kicked off by infosys and tcs in week gone by the rangebound benchmark indices settled marginally lower during the week with nifty50 falling 019 percent and bse sensex 024 percent in the week that ended on april 12 the consolidation which started after the nifty rallying to record highs is likely to continue not only in coming truncated week but also till midmay or till the general elections results on may 23 experts said adding the market is expected to get support from fiis along with stable global cues hence the major selling pressure is unlikely nifty is showing strong resilience by consolidating in the tight range of mere 200 points after the rally of nearly 1200 points also muted reactions to bad news like monsoon forecast and recent negative developments related to fmps of mutual funds suggest the absence of large selling in the market shailendra kumar chief investment officer at narnolia financial advisors told moneycontrol he said though in a definitive sense where the market would be in the short term would surely be a function of the election results the current resilience is indicating that a sharp fall if any would be a buying opportunity for the investors amit gupta of icici securities said the nifty is also supported by global equity markets which have been performing well with brexit being delayed and uschina talks continuing comfort should continue in global markets the flow of funds from foreign institutional investors fiis remained strong in week gone by as they net bought more than rs 4000 crore worth of shares taking the total april tally to over rs 14000 crore and februarymarchapril inflow to over rs 62000 crore as against a more than rs 15000 crore redemption by domestic institutional investors

earnings season will begin in the coming week with 38 companies announcing their quarterly results key companies among them to watch out for would be reliance industries wipro hdfc bank rbl bank mindtree icici lombard general insurance etc overall the nifty50 companies are expected to report strong earnings in q4 driven largely by banks and excluding banks the growth could be in single digits while the topline is likely to remain in single digit we expect bottomline growth of 286 percent in q4 fy19e although we expect a much muted topline expansion of 35 percent operating profit is expected to grow at 79 percent versus 23 percent in q3 fy19 nifty ebitda exfinancials is likely to be at 188 percent and pat margin at 101 percent elara capital said the niftys largecap universe is

to announce earnings this week wipro third major it company wipro will announce its march quarter earnings on april 16 other key thing to watch out for would be the share buyback announcement the software firm is expected to report around 1720 percent growth in dollar it services revenue and around 1315 percent in constant currency which would be within its guidance of 02 percent constant currency growth keeping in mind the macro uncertainties other key thing to watch out for would be its it services guidance for q1fy20 with the quarter passing by relatively unscathed on the macro front we expect wipros revenue growth to be in the upper half of this band  at 15 percent qoq cc our usd revenue growth estimate is 21 percent implying tailwind of 60bp from cross currencies motilal oswal said its operating performance is expected to be weak with contraction in margin it services ebit margin is expected to decline 64bps qoq to 192 percent led by slowdown in bfsi and onsite cost pressure hdfc securities said on the q1 guidance front hdfc securities expects wipro to forecast constant currency growth in the range of 12 percent while motilal oswal sees the same in 13 percent range key issues to watch for would be performance of healthcare vertical comments on sustenance of growth in bfsi vertical sustainability of margin recovery achieved in the last two quarters and the quantum of buyback that is likely to be announced with the results reliance industries and hdfc bank oilretailtotelecom major reliance industries will declare its march quarter results on april 18 and hdfc bank the countrys second largest private sector lender on april 20 hence the stock reaction to both earnings will take place on april 22 monday reliance is likely to show weaktoflat growth in refinery and petrochemical segments but key things to watch out for would be telecom  retail businesses which both are expected to support earnings motilal oswal expects 7 percent decline in refining throughput for the quarter and gross refining margin at 8 a barrel against 88 a barrel in q3fy19 petrochemical segment is expected to suffer due to reduced product margins hence reliance industries standalone earnings to be weak led by soft refining margins and lower throughput petrochemicals earnings to be resilient said prabhudas lilladher which expects standalone profit to down 5 percent qoq on consolidated basis motilal oswal expects reliance to report 6 percent sequential growth in q4 profit positive developments in the telecom and retail segments should drive growth further for the company key issues to watch for would be grm petrochemical margins telecom subscribers and future capex in case of hdfc bank brokerages expect more than 20 percent growth in net profit net interest income as well as preprovision operating profit on the back of robust loan growth loan growth is expected to remain healthy at around 23 percent yoy driven by retail loans while deposit growth is estimated at around 21 percent yoy led by an increase in term deposits motilal oswal said adding asset quality is expected to remain stable with gnpa at around 14 percent election along with earnings

and margins has been robust let me quickly provide you an update on q3 and our view of the demand environment and the progress on the six strategic themes that i talked to you about every quarter in constant currency terms our it services revenue grew by 24 which is within the guidance range amongst the verticals our banking and financial services vertical and consumer vertical continue to do well and along with the energy and utilities vertical three verticals have grown over 10 yoy in constant currency technology has had a muted growth which is normal in q3 because of furloughs but the outlook remains quite stable communications has grown well at 21 in constant currency healthcare is likely to remain soft as we overcome the uncertainty around aca the demand environment in the global market is stable we do not see any immediate impact of the macro headwinds that some of the large economies have cautioned but we continue to remain quite watchful the traction in us and asia pacific and other emerging markets remains healthy and the growth this quarter is across industry segments india will continue to remain little volatile as we undergo the restructuring and transformation of our business been talking about we remain committed to driving profitable growth and high quality of revenues now let me quickly share the update on our strategic themes our digital revenue continues to grow strongly and increased 64 sequentially and 354 yoy in q3 it now contributes 332 of our overall revenues our clients are increasingly drawing on the power of wipro digital combined with wipros traditional business to deliver new products services and experiences to their clients and employees all of this is enabled by the digitallytrained workforce which now is over 130000 employees just to give you an example of the kind of deals we are executing a north america based publishing company has awarded a multiyear process simplification and user experience transformation contract to wipro leveraging our expertise in cloud agile and wipro digitals designcentric approach through our designit acquisition we will optimize the clients global inventory and supply chain processes and enable and enhance experience for clients and consumers i continue to remain quite satisfied by our efforts on customer mining and the results have been quite robust across all buckets despite a quarter with furloughs which primarily impacts our large customers in q3 our top10 clients grew 63 sequentially in constant currency terms and 14 yoy and our top5 clients grew 97 sequentially and 191 yoy we have added one client in the 100 million bucket two in 50 million plus bucket and seven clients in the 20 million plus bucket we continue to add various different service lines to our existing customers to drive this growth in this quarter we have won incremental business to an existing infrastructure customer and now are servicing them in the data analytics and artificial intelligence space this will see our existing footprint expand as the customer embarks on its 2020 focused transformation journey on nonlinearity we continue to invest in intellectual property during q3 we filed 60 new patents taking our total patent applied count to 2113 with about 492 granted patents within our portfolio and a large number of these patents are in futuristic technology areas around data analytics artificial intelligence wireless technologies and so on and so forth we continue to execute quite well on automation or what we call as hyper automation essentially leveraging our ip which is wipro holmes platform which is now in over 350 of our clients the measure that we use to quantify our automation which is work done by bots has improved in our fixed price projects from about 3 work in q2 to about 67 work in q3 and our fixed price mix has improved to about 598 localization initiative of investments through wipro ventures now stands at 18 we incubated three new themes through our horizon program during the quarter again in the area of intelligent networks customer life cycle management and service management we continue to see strong traction on crowdsourcing on our top coder platform crowdsourcing platform top gear has now onboarded 29600 plus employees on the platform taking the total number of employees registered on the platform to over 90000 this quarter 2186 project challenges were executed successfully taking the total to about 5000 plus projects in this financial year we continue to gain recognition with industry analysts and out of over 300 reports in which wipro gets mentioned we are in the leaders quadrant in 200 reports to conclude we remain quite focused on execution on both revenue and margins as we build on our momentum on the back of strong customer relationships deep investments in digital and other big bets and consistently improving on our operating metrics and innovating the nextgeneration delivery model while we remain watchful of the macro environment now i will request you jatin to talk about the financials of q3 which is mentioned in our press release we will be very happy to take your questions from here on moderator thank you very much we will now begin the questionandanswer session the first question is from the line of sandeep agarwal from edelweiss please go ahead sandeep agarwal abid i have just two questions first of all i just wanted to know now you have spoken that digital is now 33 of our business and it is growing at 35 so almost we are talking about 10 yoy growth from digital alone for the overall company i would like to know how much deterioration in the balance of the business has already happened or what i would like to understand is will the balance of the business continue to decline or remain stable which will lead to digital becoming 50 60 of the overall business going forward or do you think that large part of pain in the nondigital side has already been behind and going forward it will at least be stable to some low single digit growth that is question 1 question 2 on digital again generally we have seen in last 20 25 years of history that a particular business line or segment when it becomes 30 35 then we start getting lot of margin benefit and also the growth numbers start coming down a little bit i understand that digital is not a segment or a vertical and it is across so obviously maybe our whole business becomes digital in next five years that is the possibility so what is your sense  are we close to that number where probably the 35 40 growth rate will cool off and the margins will also start improving significantly matured like the migration to the cloud or some of the customer experience and design areas there are still lot of investment areas across artificial intelligence machine learning big data etc so it is kind of a portfolio which still continues to require investments in spite of we being able to command a slight pricing premium as well as higher margins in this part of the business sandeep agarwal one question abid you probably missed which i wanted to know as you said that next four five years everything will be digital so does that mean also that this 35 40 rate are not sustainable because some portion as you mentioned cloud migration other things would be in the matured phase while others like artificial intelligence automation iot may be at initial phase if you can clarify little bit on that abidali z neemuchwala of course as the volume grows the pace will slow down but also remember the market size is increasing because technology is becoming part of every industry unlike 20 25 years back when technology was only used for back office processing now technology is becoming the product so some of the areas especially in our engineering services business our mobile and digital experience piece of the digital business is finding new stakeholders new areas of application in traditional industries which creates a much bigger market size so as the pie increases because of the base effect the growth rates will slow down but there is more market also that is getting created i think we will get a fair share of our pie in the market moderator thank you the next question is from the line of nitin padmanabhan from investec please go ahead nitin padmanabhan the first one is if you look at the way our hedges are and we take it on the revenue line do you think going into next year just the hedges alone will provide a good tailwind for margin for the whole year the second question is if you look at the fixed price project which is closer to 60 now and in the context of rising onsite cost with the supply tightness there our ability to sort of absorb that with the fixed price kind of situation do you see that sort of impacting margins when we think from a slightly longerterm perspective considering that the supply side may remain tight we internally of course work with a tight regiment of fixed outcome on forex that business can work with and build their cost structures around it and we leave the volatility of the forex to be managed in good hands of our treasury so overall i will say it has played out well so far this year and we will continue to see how it pans out on your second question on increase impact of the localization as a cost i would put a couple of points and i will request saurabh to talk about the cost of localization and our endeavors there but very principally fixed price project means that our delivery team owns outcome and therefore they have higher maneuverability around the type of automation they can put in type of resources they can engage with so to that extent in fact it is less of an impact on fixed price projects on tm side you are able to price yourself as you go so to that extent you are also not impacted there too but overall localization as a theme is a very important theme for our competitiveness in future i request saurabh to talk about saurabh govil nitin on localization it is a journey which we started three years back it is not that we have started today i think we saw it coming early we have doubled our localization in key markets over the last three years in a very planned fashion we have first started hiring locally then now we have made a good network from local colleges building teams training people creating development centers across a big market of north america and doing it so it is not sudden reaction to managing demand there because we anticipated it planned it and we are moving ahead there is a crunch of stem talent in the us but that is true and we feel that we are much better positioned given that we have done it in a muchplanned fashion nitin padmanabhan i think almost the entire or bulk of the growth has entirely come from digital operations and platforms which we earlier used to call bpo so in that context do you see the rest of the practice is sort of pulling up going forward what is your thought there and second is in the context of the ops sort of growth and it is pretty broadbased just your thoughts on how that sort of worked your way number primarily because of certain geographical restructuring that we are looking at but overall all the propositions are becoming very relevant for the market and it is also validated by the external analyst reports that we see where we are being rated as leaders in about 200 of the reports that we have participated of the 300 that we work with moderator thank you the next question is from the line of ravi menon from elara capital please go ahead ravi menon first is a book keeping question you used to provide the cost of revenue sales and marketing and ga for it services and it products separately you yourself evaluate it services margin could you give that please jatin dalal the investor relations team will circulate it and publish it shortly after the call ravi menon secondly on q4 guidance it seems slightly muted any headwinds that you anticipate especially in the healthcare or something else that you want to call out the transformation of our india business which will continue to be a little volatile next couple of quarters and that has been incorporated and fundamental transformation of our manufacturing business which may take another couple of quarters that has been incorporated as well otherwise mostly we see demand inline with what we have been seeing in the past few quarters ravi menon and abid one last question about health business unit there you said that open enrollment are actually pe 10 of enrolment this quarter you posted pretty good growth in the health business unit so any large deals there that has helped positive growth jatin dalal ravi since your voice was not very clear is your question why the health has seen a growth in q3 when open enrolment actually fell as per abids commentary ravi menon that is right sorry i have a very bad cold jatin dalal so ravi that is because our open enrolment does have some one time increase when we actually complete that annual activity in q3 and that has flown into the revenue stream for q3 but on a secular basis there will be a decline that will be visible from q4 onwards moderator thank you our next question is from the line of vibhor singhal from phillipcapital please go ahead for long this has been our weak link and now with whatever prices that the crude is at being highly volatile what is the outlook that you see for this segment last few years and also it is reflected in a very provision for doubtful debt recovery in q3 and that is reflected in terms of lower ga expenses for quarter abidali z neemuchwala bala is on the call ns bala who is our president for the energy and utilities business will give you a color on that business which has been transformed quite well have been able to create vibhor singhal so bala if i could just probe a bit further on that basically is the transformation solely driven by our initiative of aligning our investments to their requirements or are we also seeing an increased demand or lets say a momentum from their side in terms of deal flow size which could probably give us more visibility about the future quarters n s bala there is a little bit of both in that vibhor i would say that the customers are continuing to spend a little bit more aggressively on application modernization but the bigger impact has actually been the alignment of our investments to the modernization that the customers are doing as well as on the digital work that they are doing in data analytics space and like i said the clock transformation so that is actually yielding the results like i said vibhor singhal sure so would it be safe to assume barring any macro shocks or any unforeseen events our revival in this segment should probably continue maybe at a higher or a lower pace than what it was this quarter not to do with the number but directionally do you believe it should continue in the positive direction that it has been over the last few quarters n s bala yes we believe that we have kind of stabilized the major issues that were impacting us in the past so i would say that there is a reasonable degree of positivity about next few quarters i would not comment on how much that could be but in general directionally like you said we seem to be headed in the right direction vibhor singhal jatin just last thing on the ga expense that you mentioned as you mentioned the reason that this quarter we saw a good recovery in provisions so considering this as an exception i mean this kind of a recovery in this quarter do you believe the ga expense to probably revert to the earlier quarterly runrates that we had before not necessary the last quarter but lets say if i were to take the average of the last six or seven quarters that could generally be the forwardlooking ga expense jatin dalal that is right vibhor i think right way that you have explained we should look at a trend over a few quarters because there have been ups and downs if you see the ga trend over the last six quarters moderator thank you our next question is from the line of viju george from jp morgan please go ahead viju george i had a question on the analyst mentions that you sighted you said that you are regarded as a leader in 200 of the 300 reports if you look at some of the common areas where you have leadership because this i think also looks at some of your peers as well what could be those areas where you think you have got leadership with respect to peers as identified by these analyst reports abidali z neemuchwala so typically when you look at these reports as you rightly said two or three of our peers would also be participating there but in some reports especially in the new age areas of digital ai some of the stuff that we talked about business transformation in the areas of data and analytics i think we are creating a differentiated capability and that gets reflected in these reports viju george and these are all technologies and capabilities that has been integrated into larger projects as we speak as well i presume abidali z neemuchwala that is correct viju george on margin improvement yes i think it is ga driven what will be our target or the comfort margin operating range because at some level we could say that you might still have some room to move up given where peer margins are but on the other hand some guys would say that peer margins might have to move down so from wipros perspective for the growth it wants to achieve is there a target not a guidance but kind of a target margin range where you feel comfortable where there will always be quarterly variation for example in the current quarter we have given salary increases to some of our people which will impact our margins in q4 and we will continue to as i said remain invested and make incremental investments even in q4 on our big bets so that would be an additional step so overall viju the answer is yes we feel comfortable in the trajectory which we have demonstrated in q2 q3 but goal will be to do investment create differentiation and create growth very sustainable here on where you can have broad based growth for many more verticals beyond bfsi and therefore make it much easier for wipro to close the revenue gap relative to larger peers if you have participation do you think we are beginning to tick those boxes as we speak abidali z neemuchwala that is right viju you rightly observed if you look at the constant currency qonq growth across our verticals except technology which also as you know is because of the furlough impact is maximum in the technology vertical i am very pleased with a very secular growth across various verticals that we have seen a couple of them may have a couple of more volatile quarters like manufacturing or health but at least three of the six business units have delivered doubledigityearonyear growth for us so that does feel quite comfortable to me viju george you feel that this can sustain going forward that we would not have out the volatility i feel quite comfortable that it is sustainable we have got good customer acquisitions we have got good deal flow we have good demand pipeline and we have got capabilities and offerings that we have invested in and we have customized for those domains where we see good customer attraction viju george sure and lastly i am sorry for taking too much time abid all of yours incremental growth comes in digital and typically there is a view that digital is important for clients competitive advantage so do you think that when you look at the nature of development work that is coming for you and maybe for industry since it is strategic since it is competitive advantage driven it becomes less susceptible to macro shift or you think if clients want to cut back they will cut back regardless of whether digital or not are we more resilient today than seven eight years back look at the nature of developmental spending that is coming out revenue generating activities and i would believe that the impact would not be as high again we have not seen a cycle of slowdown post the digital transformation era so this is still something which needs to be tested out but i would agree with you on the basic hypothesis moderator thank you our next question is from the line of sumit jain from goldman sachs please go ahead sumit jain so firstly wanted to understand on your margin front we have seen a pretty good sharp improvement and you highlighted ga as one of the reasons but if i probe about the other margin levers can you comment a bit on your onsite effort and utilization how much more room do you have because particularly on the onsite effort you guys are at 22 which is one of the lowest compared to your peers and given that more the new digital projects have more onsite centric nature can you believe that you can still further increase the offshoring out there this automation is with us similarly on development side of the house internal crowd sourcing that we do which i update on the top gear theme is what delivers savings and a lot of the improvement that you see in margin comes from those operational levers so those are the futuristic operation levers and i wouldnt limit our conversation only to utilization and offshoring and those kind of levers which we continue to work on nonetheless i will let jatin kind of give a more specific split of the numbers jatin dalal so sumit thanks for your question and in some form i think which you also mentioned and i want to clarify that it is optically looking like that there are lower ga expenses but there are two opposite impacts there our cost of delivery has certainly improved due to the factors just that abid spoke about automation better execution of fixed priced projects crowd sourcing and so on and so forth we do have a slightly higher expense line on depreciation and amortization in q3 which is impacting that overall line and we have an offset of that in some form in form of a superior execution on pdd so overall improvement is seeming like optically from the ga line but the way we look at it as a management is really superior execution of delivery that we have done sumit jain thats helpful my second question is around i mean you guys have seen achieving a very high localization in us almost to 63 kind of levels now so can you just comment what kind of utilization and attrition levels are you seeing in us for yourself are they higher lower than your company average typically cost sitting in the us but there is something which needs to be looked at very carefully because we are seeing a situation where attrition can go up there given the crunch of the stem talent in the country sumit jain and maybe lastly on your capital allocation policy any thoughts around the share buyback will we see in this financial year and lets say in case it gets pushed out to the next financial year how are you planning to maintain your capital allocation policy of around 45 to 50 of net income being paid out jatin dalal so sumit we have shared this before we are dependent on completion of our merger of our subsidiaries and it is taking procedurally a longer time than what we initially envisaged so we will play it by the year as i have mentioned we have always looked at payout policy over block of years so as and when one is deciding the next dividend payout or next payout decision one would be able to calibrate in what point in time we are and therefore what should be the right decision around it moderator thank you our next question is from the line of sandeep shah from cimb please go ahead sandeep shah just abid question is in terms of guidance so if i look at last year fourth quarter we still had a slightly higher portfolio related issues and the contributions from those including india was higher which might have declined over four quarters at that time we had guided 1 2 3 kind of growth rates this time with more confidence on the demand as well as the deal closures which are happening we are guiding for 0 to 2 so you are saying you are factoring macro issues but in your initial remarks you also said there is no immediate impact of the macro so can you give us some color why this is if you can clear some confusion on this our healthcare business specifically hps and the lower enrollment the two others are around both macroeconomic situation which we are very watchful of primarily both in our large markets in the us as well as in the uk and as we keep seeing renewals as you know this is end of the year timeframe where a lot of our contracts get renewed which are annual contracts or quarterly contracts and as we see the pace of those renewals our confidence continues to go up right now we have guided based on the current state that we see as i said our order booking has been really robust over the last two quarters and some of that gets reflected in the guidance as we ramp up those deals in the january february march quarter and q1 of next financial year sandeep shah jatin question on the margins so based on the replies which you have given you mean to say that 198 is a maintainable margin with a narrow band is it the way we should look for jatin dalal i think you should look at the improvement that we have done in q2 and q3 i think there will be quarterly volatilities in every quarter including some of the investments that we continue to make as i mentioned and i think our endeavor would be to remain in this trajectory sandeep shah so you mean to say 186 to 198 is the trajectory which you are looking which is q2 q3 margins jatin dalal yes that is right but there is forex includes there etc so i am therefore not quantifying a number or a band which can be deemed as a guidance i am saying this is the operational execution that we are comfortable around there will be puts and takes there will be forex volatility but this trajectory is what we are comfortable about sandeep shah just one clarification if i look at the line item lifetime expected credit loss and a provision for deferred contract cost on qonq there is almost like a positive swing of rs 170 crores which is rs 112 basis point to the consolidated revenue at the same time you also mentioned depreciation has some impairment which is some 835 which is rs 84 crores so roughly puts and takes if you look at the positive impact is still higher by close to around rs70 crores rs 80 crores so how should we look at it will it reverse going forward demonstrated in past by a margin sandeep shah so for the negative number is it largely the earlier bad debts being recovered or there is something else also in terms of lifetime abidali z neemuchwala no this is when we execute projects and they are dependent on certain outcome that we are able to demonstrate or sometimes it is just the delay on customer side to process payment especially if it is linked with any bureaucratic sort of organization so we have provided based on our policy of time base which we provided and then we did recovery it came as a positive moderator thank you our next question is from the line of surendra goyal from citigroup please go ahead surendra goyal abid are you being able to retain the gains that you achieved due to such sharp increase in automation levels or is this in line with what was already promised to the customer and followup on the same question jatin so this kind of benefits which come because of any margin improvement should be visible at a gross margin level is that understanding right abidali z neemuchwala so surendra right now both automation gains and forex gains if you see we have been able to retain and pass it through reflecting in our operating margins over time as you know very well when deals come up for renewals and productivity milestones hit some of these things need to be shared with customers which is the normal rhythm of our business goods sold line surendra goyal sorry could you just clarify what is the additional cost in cost of goods line jatin dalal so this in some form the amortization line and couple of other expenses which is higher and ga where we had a large pdd reversal is sitting as a gain and therefore you are seeing it as a gain so you are not seeing the benefit of operational improvement in the cost of goods sold line moderator thank you ladies  gentlemen that was the last question i now hand the conference over to aparna iyer for closing comments

WIPRO,the grass is always greener on the other side some analysts prefer to say the same thing about the ecommerce businesses the biggest buzz in the industry lately some unlisted ecommerce names such as ani technologies ola oravel stays   and one97 communications   have been creating quite a splash in the unlisted market mainly on the strength of their titular value drawing in small and retail investors many such investors flocking to these counters are not even aware of the challenges of the unlisted space especially with regard value fluctuation and limited liquidity many are drawn to such propositions on the lure of attractive valuations and herd mentality according to abhishek securities a firm dealing in unlisted shares ola oyo rooms and paytm are currently priced at rs 27500 rs 75000 and rs 17000 respectively in the unlisted space that even when these companies continue to incur losses one 97 communications which houses the main payments business of paytm reported an over fourfold rise in consolidated revenue in fy18 at rs 33148 crore but losses swelled to rs 160605 crore from rs 90309 crore in fy17 as per data sourced from tofler meanwhile paytm mall reported a loss of rs 178755 crore on a total revenue of rs 77486 crore in fy18 as it looks to compete with walmartbacked flipkart and amazon india which together hold 80 per cent market share combined losses of one 97 and paytm mall swelled 270 per cent to rs 3393 crore in fy18 from rs 917 crore in fy17 while combined revenues went up by 417 per cent during the same period to rs 4089 crore for the year ended march 2018 oyo india reported a marginal widening of net loss to rs 360 crore for india operations against rs 355 crore loss reported for the previous financial year oyo indias revenue growth has

unmatched margin net loss of the ecommerce giant grew over 700 per cent in fy18 though revenue growth during the period was 39 per cent in fy18 flipkart india reported a rs rs 2060 crore loss against rs 245 crore in the previous year what then justifies the skyhigh valuations that these stocks are commanding in the unlisted space business models in ecommerce industry in general differ from traditional businesses they do not owe or possess any tangible assets like land plant or warehouse also they incur huge losses and do not have any other reserve as well despite this their valuations keep going up to billions remember flipkart sold its controlling stake to at rs 111 lakh crore says sandip ginodia of abhishek securities dinesh gupta partner at unlistedzonecom explains the arithmetic of valuing an ecommerce entity ecommerce outfits are virtual shops and they are valued by their sales at 10 to 15 times of annual sales the multiple may be even higher in certain cases depending on growth stage of the segment he said fair value of any stock is very subjective till it gets listed different sets of people can value the same thing using different methods to arrive at different numbers here one sees value in something and the other does not says ginodia arun mukherjee a kolkatabased value investor and cofounder of sebiregistered sa investment advisors says there is a great fool theory at work behind the humungous valuations that these companies command that theory says it is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they are overvalued and by selling them for a profit at a later date this is because there will always be someone a bigger or greater fool willing to pay a higher price he said even the largest ecommerce company of the world amazon does not make any money ginodia points out ecommerce is a global trend which is why such a company will be valued higher even when they do not have any asset or profits since there is no structural mechanism they are inflating valuations at will ecommerce is the new trend currently but once sentiment weakens investors may rush to offload them these companies are valued only on the basis of top line and the growth they show it is very hard to arrive at fair value said ginodia gupta says when a company is not listed it does not need to focus on investors it does not opt for any mechanism like rights issue or bonus issue which may downgrade their stock value this is why any valuation is considered okay again price alone cannot be a determinant of attractiveness of a stock mrf currently trades around rs 55000 at 20 times the eps of rs 2600 this is does mean that the stock is not investorfriendly similarly if had not given any bonus or split its share the stock value would have been rs 5 lakh today they split it to ensure liquidity for investors gupta said ecommerce stocks do not see much volume in the unlisted space mostly because of high valuations if they are to be listed in the stock market the valuation will not be even 1100th of what they are demanding they are priced so high but you would still buy it thinking that some another buyer will come later on says mukherjee he said investors should be very cautious while investing in the unlisted space flipkart is making billions of losses every year you are making sales in penny but are valued in millions this is crazy there is no in it at some point these bubbles will burst for sure mukherjee said according to him indian customers fall for discounts and offers and this is what the ecommerce companies are tapping to do business but this is unlikely to continue forever they will not make any profit anytime soon perhaps next three to five years some analysts say some promoters like those of the ecommerce giants want their stocks to trade at a premium among select investors this is why companies like mrf page industries or shree cements do not opt for a stock split or bonus issues ola has slashed all discounts and will be in profit in a year or two people will be using ola as they have got used to it now at a later stage paytm may start charging a fee for its services it is active in many services which will in turn enhance revenue this is be the business model and most ecommerce companies follow the same said

recognised larsen and toubro as its promoter within a day of the engineering giant acquiring a majority stake but hpcl has steadfastly refused to acknowledge its new promoter ongc reached for comments a hpcl spokesperson said an advice was received some time back from government of india stating that president of india continues to be the promoter of hpcl and ongc is also to be shown as promoter of hpcl below president of india hpcl being a listed cpse clarifications details were required from multiple agencies authorities to ensure compliance to various stipulations applicable to listed companies including companies act sebi regulations etc as soon as all the clarificationsdetails are received from concerned agencies authorities necessary amendments as required will be made in the regulatory filings after following due process till such time status quo is being maintained in the regulatory filings the spokesperson said in an email response while hpcl management has been unrelenting oil minister in written replies to questions in parliament had listed the company as a subsidiary of ongc the government too has been treating hpcl as ongc subsidiary and its headhunter public enterprises selection board pesb on june 17 called ongc chairman and managing director shashi shanker to assist in selecting the new director finance of hpcl sources said the chairman of ongc

guidelines states that in the case of subsidiaries the fulltime chairman of the holding company is invited to assist the board sources said going by these guidelines ongc chairman and managing director was invited to sit on the interview panel to select hpcl director finance it is clarified that both hpcl and ongc are listed companies independently managed by their respective boards and the above issue does not have any impact on the functioning or the coordination between the companies synergy groups of the two companies are working to identify synergy areas some of which are acted upon and some are work in progress efforts are directed to ensure that no value is lost for the stakeholders and further value is created by leveraging synergies hpcl has always followed high standards of corporate governance and will continue to do so in future also hpcl spokesperson added sources said the government had earlier this year asked hpcl to add ongc as its copromoter but the oil refining company sought to delay it by seeking further clarifications while the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ongc a lack of it keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it gets full agenda of every board meeting of hpcl and can be aware of pricesensitive information according to the securities and exchange board of indias rules the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company when ioc had bought the governments stake in fuel retailer ibp co ltd it was listed as the latters promoter in every instance after the deal the same was the case when ioc acquired a majority stake in chennai petroleum corp ltd cpcl since acquiring a majority stake in hpcl ongc has only been able to appoint one director to that firms board sources said ltds governance structure which the hpcl management has so often cited to allow surana retain the chairman and managing director designation even though there cannot be two chairmen within a group clearly provides for the holding company chairman to sit on the panel for selecting directors of subsidiary companies coal india is a holding company and has seven subsidiaries the board of each of the subsidiaries is headed by a chairman and coal india too has a chairman and managing director to head the board but on pesb interview panels to select a

capitalisation on thursday sensex scaled a record high of 38487 while nifty50 marked its alltime high of 11620 this week is likely to be a volatile one as august series futures and options contracts expire on thursday moreover there are some key macro data lined up for release during the week including gdp numbers for june quarter fiscal deficit data and infrastructure output data for july all these factors will sway market this week however analysts see stockspecific opportunities in pockets of the market based on their recommendations here are 12 that can potentially deliver healthy gains over the next 1121 sessions this stock has almost formed a higher bottom on the daily chart taking support at the significant 50 dma which lies at around 72 the stock has been maintaining a positive bias the rsi has also been on the rise with the chart looking attractive we anticipate a decent rise from here on for the stock to scale rs 8890 levels in the coming days with good volume participation we recommend a buy rating on this stock parekh said this stock has formed a double bottom pattern on the daily chart at around rs 332 level and has seen a decent bounce it has moved past the previous peak of rs 385 which is also the 200 dma thus signifying a positive bias we expect the stock to rise in the coming days with rsi on the rise and good consistent volume participation we recommend a buy rating on this stock parekh said the stock has validated the hammer candle pattern formed on the weekly chart in the previous week moved above the candles high which is the confirmation of a bullish reversal the price is in a larger upward retracement leg from the low of rs 97 in which two legs were completed and third rising leg is on the cards apart from this it has formed higher top and higher bottom in smaller degree which is a bullish dow signal more upside is expected in the coming days in addition the price is well above the key moving averages of 21 and 50day ema and this could add strength to the bulls the stock price has validated an engulfing bull pattern on the weekly chart in the previous week which confirms a bullish signal the price pattern has completed a major threewave decline from rs 782 to rs 648 with an irregular wave b in that move the stock has formed a double bottom around rs 648 interestingly that is the zone for change of polarity now the stock is in a rising leg from the low of rs 648 which could head towards a new lifetime high in addition the price is placed well above the important 21day 50day and 200day emas and this could add further strength to the bulls this stock peaked in the last quarter of 2017 in the rs 280284 range and after forming a minor double top it was in a sideways trajectory the stock has been consolidating in a broad range after having stalled its upward move it has been forming a good base in the rs 195210 zone currently it rests at its 100wma after pulling back from those support levels the rsi is neutral against the price showing no divergence but it is marking higher bottom and moving out of a pattern the weekly macd has shown a positive crossover and is now trading above its signal line indicating a bullish signal the prices have pulled back after forming a reversal candle near its pattern support some upward move in prices cannot be ruled out we expect the stock to test its upper range of the channel any move below rs 200 will be negative for the stock vaishnav said this stock has exhibited strong signs of an end to the corrective move and signalled a potential trend reversal after peaking out near rs 795 the stock has witnessed a corrective move over the past few months while making subsequent lower tops it is also showing signs that point towards a likely trend reversal while the stock saw a sharp corrective decline onbalance volume or obv did not fall the bottom is forming in the rs 530550 zone and the recent pullback from the immediate lows has been accompanied with higher volumes a fresh buy signal has emerged over stochastic on the weekly charts with a bullish divergence against the price an upward price revision cannot be ruled out over the coming days any move below rs 520 will be negative for the stock pidilite has seen a breakout from the downtrend line resistance and is moving in an upward sloping parallel channel momentum indicator macd is in buy mode both on the daily as well as weekly charts the stock seems to have completed a wave iv correction and wave v up seems to have started hence we recommend buying this stock said thakkar axis bank has seen a breakout form the symmetrical triangular pattern on the monthly charts with a buy crossover in momentum indicator on the monthly chart which is an absolutely bullish indication for the medium term with this the stock seems to have completed a wave iv correction and wave v up has started lupin has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily charts and seems to have completed the right shoulder of the same the stock has again started forming higher tops and bottoms which is positive in the short to medium term it is likely to test the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern on the upside from here on hence we recommend buying this stock the analyst said after a multimonth correction from the high of rs 226 registered in august 2017 this counter appears to have formed a durable bottom around rs 174 last july the subsequent rally from the low of rs 174 to a recent high of rs 194 also retraced 382 per cent thereby creating a shortterm bottom of rs 184 if the trend has changed for good then it should scale much higher levels in due course hence positional traders should buy this stock for an initial target of rs 207 with a stop loss below rs 184 on a closing basis after a multiquarter underperformance from the high of rs 1247 registered in august 2015 this counter appears to have hit a bottom last month at a low of rs 613 as it tested the lower boundary of the twoyearold downsloping channel subsequent price action with sharp rallies suggests the counter is back on the radar of the bulls traders are advised to make use of the current correction to create fresh longs at current prices and add further on declines around rs 740 for a projected price target of rs 798 stop loss is suggested for the trade below rs 735 on a closing basis this counter has registered a strong technical breakout on massive volumes above its 100day moving average from where all the pullback rallies got sold off on multiple occasions in the past hence sustaining above rs 77 level can potentiality lift the stock to its logical target of rs 99 positional traders are advised to buy this stock for a target of rs 97 with a stop loss below rs 75 on a closing basis,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/12-stock-ideas-that-analysts-say-can-deliver-solid-gains-in-3-weeks/articleshow/65558082.cms,1159.4,27-08-2018,1151.35,PIDILITIND,11:02,12

indirect taxes out of the ambit of the union budget the governments annual fiscal roadmap has largely ceased to be material for stock investors they now only look for policies and schemes that can have trickledown effect on any sector or stock and the rural theme with implications for a number of sectors is in focus this time around the agriculture sector contributes about 17 per cent of indias gdp but employs over 50 per cent of the total workforce and thus has a key place in the demandsupply equation economists point out that despite various efforts by the government gross value addition of the agriculture agrigva sector has been declining in recent times and the share of investment to agrigva has been falling consistently see chart therefore there is a need to make some structural changes in agriculture starting from marketing to exports to double farmers income by 2022 an over 30 per cent slump in bse auto index since the union budget unveiled on february 1 2018 against a 10 per cent rise in benchmark sensex has been partially attributed to a rural distress which has also dented demand for fmcg goods the bse fmcg index is up just 5 per cent the gap between rural and urban

highlighted that capital formation in the agriculture sector has stagnated significantly a trend reversal there can help achieve the objective of doubling farm income by 2022 this can be achieved by providing an incentive to agriterm loans for investment purpose through an enabling mechanism of either interest subvention or credit guarantee fund it said at present the crop insurance scheme called pms fasal bima yojana pmfby covers three types of crops namely food crops cereals millets and pulses oilseeds annual commercial or horticulture crops which account for only 30 per cent of the total crop loans of banks government should cover all types of crops under pmfby which will help banks manage risks and also make a statement of intent in the budget to increase income support from rs 6000

in no time somehow the index is refusing to reflect the uncertainties like delayed monsoon and nbfc crisis or ongoing economic slowdown said raamdeo agrawal a market veteran and joint managing director at motilal oswal financial services the union budget is a very big event for the market as it will hold cues on what the government is planning to do over the next five years right now the market is ignoring good things in the economy and focusing only on the slowdown as an investor you should think about the next five years the strong political mandate for the government has a lot of meaning i am cautiously optimistic and remain invested in the market i would not wait too long for further clearance of the sky to decide my further allocation agrawal said speculation is rife that the government will address financial sector troubles like rising nonperforming assets and liquidity crisis in nbfcs which will in turn help lift consumption demand therefore there could be action in sectors like auto fmcg housing and building materials specific sectors which might benefit from this budget include healthcare or pharma banking fmcg and housing finance says arun thukral md  ceo axis securities any budget incentives to build the healthcare infrastructure will benefit the pharma sector there are also expectations of a roadmap for banking reforms including consolidation of the stateowned lenders to support the economy in the next phase of growth there is a high probability that this budget would see higher allocation for recapitalisation of psu banks this in turn will
