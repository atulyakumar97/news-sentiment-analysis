YES BANK,highlights  do not sell at this price but wait for capital raising ever since the declaration of the quarterly result the yes bank stock has been falling continuously and the decline is now close to 50 percent are all the concerns priced in or is there worse to come it was common knowledge since rbi had denied a fresh term to founder ceo rana kapoor that all was not well with the bank the reported pristine asset quality 13 percent gross npa at the end of fy18 amidst the challenge in the banking space was always suspect though the rbi clean chit after the audit of fy18 numbers provided some ray of hope the kitchen sink quarter q4 fy19 under the new ceo ravneet gill whose name was approved by the regulator raised more questions on the quality of the book and governance standards at the bank more skeletons in the closet instead of drawing comfort from the cleanup exercise investors started worrying about the hidden exposure to troubled sectors and groups going by the grapevine the exposure to troubled assets could be as high as rs 26000 crore much higher than the subinvestment grade book that is a little over rs 17000 crore declared by the bank so far it is pertinent to note that the bank saw over rs 11000 crore addition in this category in a single quarter according to the management they have created adhoc contingency provision of rs 2100 crore on lowrated standard assets of close to rs 10000 crore in q4 the net worth of the bank is a little over rs 26904 crore and going by the grapevines number if there is little recovery the entire net worth could get eroded gill however in his media interactions reiterated the credit cost guidance at 125 basis points in fy20 209 basis points for fy19 only the earnings of the coming quarters will show the size of the hole and how fast the cleanup is taking place with the economy in the slow lane one cannot rule out more skeletons coming out of the closet the backdoor entry of the promoter the shadow control of the promoter has also remained an overhang reports suggest the promoter is reportedly making a claim for a board seat while rbi has appointed r gandhi to bolster the ceos authority in the cleanup exercise of the bank gill has made it unequivocally clear that he wants to be on the right side of the regulator by adopting superior risk management and the highest standards of corporate governance in terms of the nearterm micro outcomes a focus on retail both on assets as well as liabilities with more crossselling decentralisation of functions making branches profitable are high on the agenda strengthening the banks digital leadership and sweating the database more effectively is also on the cards the earnings impact of the cleanup while the growth may be cleaner it will certainly be more moderate the impact of the less risky book and reversal of interest income due to prompt npa recognition will be felt on nii net interest income or the difference between interest income and interest expenses fee income will be modest thanks to prudent accounting practices that the bank has started adopting from q4 fy19 while it is good to know that the bank is on a reform path the new ceo has to walk the talk to convince investors he has to have the support of his team and a free hand without any interference of the promoter shareholders as of now there is no clarity on this front and it remains to be seen if gill succeeds in getting capital on the basis of his intended cleanup story alone with the share price falling to rs 120 from rs 404 raising capital at this valuation itself may not be a worthwhile proposition so earnings will remain weak and contradictory news flow will keep serious investors on the sidelines until yes bank succeeds in raising capital we attempted to look at the stress case valuation of yes bank assuming elevated credit cost of 240 basis points and 220 basis points in fy20 and fy21 respectively along with lower interest margin and noninterest earnings the market podcast  poor earnings fii exits drag d street but silver lining ahead copyright  eeighteencom ltd all rights reserved reproduction of news articles photos videos or any other content in whole or in part in any form or medium without express writtern permission of moneycontrolcom is prohibited copyright  eeighteencom ltd all rights resderved reproduction of news articles photos videos or any other content in whole or in part in any form or medium without express writtern permission of moneycontrolcom is prohibited,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/yes-bank-a-falling-knife-but-should-you-catch-it-4095431.html,115.05,14-06-2019,117.1,YESBANK,19:32,yes bank  a falling knife but should you catch it,moneycontrol

for the information in the form and manner of disclosure prescribed by regulations therefore the press release breaches confidentiality and violates regulatory guidelines moreover nil divergence is not an achievement to be published and is only compliance with the extant income recognition and asset classification norms the rbi said in its letter this may adversely impact the stock price in the coming week globally all eyes would be on ongoing tussle between the us and china the recent slowdown in chinas economic growth is also a cause of concern for global investors growing confidence that the united states and china will resolve their ongoing trade dispute will help boost global investor sentiments those talks will restart next week in washington with both sides saying this weeks negotiations in beijing showed progress clarity on brexit would also act as a key trigger for investor interest investors have turned cautious ahead of the forthcoming general election investors sentiments were dampened by the steep decline in shares of certain largecap and midcap companies amidst mixed earnings performance in q3fy19 all the sectoral indices lost value over the last seven sessions the equity markets have turned very volatile and even massive companies are not spared the recent volatility in stock prices of tata motors dr reddys sun pharma yes bank vedanta essel group companies anil ambani group companies is a matter of concern as retail investors are getting trapped with every newsflow as a result we advise investors to be cautious on the newsflow in markets do proper analysis and neither rush to take fresh positions or square off the existing positions or holdings on disturbing newsflows unless getting a proper clarity of a particular event or on companys performance we believe domestic bourses would remain volatile till general election results are out there would be temporary headwinds for investors but on the long term we believe the indian equity markets are in a structural bull run as the benefits of implementation of gst insolvency and bankruptcy code digitisation thrust on make in india and improving relations with key foreign countries would augur well for the economy the strategy at present should be to invest in a phased manner only in companies that are not connected to any political party have a robust business model strong earnings and cashflow visibility low debt and backed by quality management especially on the corporate governance front considering the above factors investors can have a stock specific approach in midcap and smallcap space as there are many companies that are trading at a discount of 5070 percent to their peak price in early 2018 on a safer side we would suggest investors look at consumption
