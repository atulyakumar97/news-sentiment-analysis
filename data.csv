ICICI BANK LTD.,equity investors on dalal street are waiting for the full union budget to see if it contains what is needed to revive the domestic equity market and put it on a rising trajectory there are expectations that finance minister nirmala sitharaman would announce some policy measures that can boost the sagging economy create jobs and to address rural distress among other key concerns equity benchmark sensex has risen around 10 per cent since the last full budget in february 2018 riding a handful of stocks such as ril hdfc twins and bajaj finance among other while 80 per cent of

in no time somehow the index is refusing to reflect the uncertainties like delayed monsoon and nbfc crisis or ongoing economic slowdown said raamdeo agrawal a market veteran and joint managing director at motilal oswal financial services the union budget is a very big event for the market as it will hold cues on what the government is planning to do over the next five years right now the market is ignoring good things in the economy and focusing only on the slowdown as an investor you should think about the next five years the strong political mandate for the government has a lot of meaning i am cautiously optimistic and remain invested in the market i would not wait too long for further clearance of the sky to decide my further allocation agrawal said speculation is rife that the government will address financial sector troubles like rising nonperforming assets and liquidity crisis in nbfcs which will in turn help lift consumption demand therefore there could be action in sectors like auto fmcg housing and building materials specific sectors which might benefit from this budget include healthcare or pharma banking fmcg and housing finance says arun thukral md  ceo axis securities any budget incentives to build the healthcare infrastructure will benefit the pharma sector there are also expectations of a roadmap for banking reforms including consolidation of the stateowned lenders to support the economy in the next phase of growth there is a high probability that this budget would see higher allocation for recapitalisation of psu banks this in turn will strengthen the banking sector thukral said based on these assumptions and various brokerage recommendations we collated a list of stocks that can potentially deliver healthy returns if the budget

ICICI BANK LTD.,eight years ago when dr was serving his second term as prime minister and indias retail inflation neared 9 per cent the central bank chose to have a hard look at the liquidity adjustment framework to make its rate signals more effective a panel headed by reserve bank of india executive director deepak mohanty suggested that the liquidity adjustment facility operate in a mode with the repo rate the rate at which lends to banks being the single policy rate to unambiguously signal monetary policy stance citing an example the panel said a 100 bps change in the repo causes around 80 bps change in the weighted average call rate wacr over a month however the strength of the response turns out to be relatively small in a liquidity situation in theory the job of the central bank is to anchor the overnight call money rate around the policy rate while this objective works better in developed economies it remained pretty wayward in india over the last decade keeping liquidity in deficit is easier said than done the banking system was awash with funds after demonetisation when humble savers were forced to dig out money kept under the mattresses and deposit them in banks former governor urjit patel did his bit to suck out liquidity and restore normalcy but then lost his chair for sticking to his ground on slightly deficit liquidity even after the nonbank credit crisis of 2018 antagonising the government patel had a rift with the fiscal authority on issues such as the fate of rbis excess reserves and central bank autonomy his successor shaktikanta das who initially followed the 2011 liquidity guidance has now flagged expectations of easier flow of funds setting up an internal working group that will review the existing liquidity management framework suggest measures to simplify the system and clearly communicate the objectives quantitative measures and toolkit of liquidity management the group is expected to submit its report by midjuly system liquidity was in surplus of rs 16500 crore at the end of last week vs rs 49500 crore in the previous week liquidity in the system turned into an average daily surplus in june after remaining in deficit during april and most of may due to restrained government spending rbi said that transmission of the cumulative reduction of 50 bps in the policy repo rate in february and april 2019 was 21 bps to the weighted average lending rate walr on fresh rupee loans interest rates on longer tenor money market instruments remained broadly aligned with the overnight weighted average call rate reflecting near full transmission of the reduction in policy rate the central bank lowered the policy rate by another 25 bps on june 6 making it the straight third rate cut in the year the central bank has also changed its stance to accommodative from neutral which means there would be no possibility of a rate hike in the near horizon more critically das said that the central bank would ensure adequate liquidity in the system for all productive purposes there are many options for the new committee the reserve banks mpc could be advised to look beyond the wacr to gauge the liquidity situation in the economy like major central banks mpc should look at the entire term structure of money market rates to gauge the efficacy of its liquidity stance said b prasanna head of global markets groups at  second rbi may ease the daily crr maintenance framework from the current 99 per cent compliance to 80 per cent or so this will be indirectly relaxing crr without officially cutting it this will improve the banking liquidity condition corporate bond yields in the secondary market in april and may were lower than the lending rate of banks indicative of the faster transmission of the rbi rate cuts in the bond markets corporate bond yields weighted average in the secondary markets were 9 bps lower than the banks marginal costbased lending rate mclr in april and 44 bps lower in may said care ratings the 10year government securities benchmark yield has also declined by about 56 basis points from its average in april 2019 to about 686 per cent the softening of bond yields in the secondary market and the consequent softening in the cost of borrowing in the primary market coincided with a rise in bond issuances prime database showed an 86 per cent monthly jump in volume to rs 45539 crore in may the weighted average cost of issuances in the primary market was 13 bps lower at 849 per cent compared to the monthago rate at the heart of the mismatch between the rbis policy and the banks failure to pass on the benefit to the borrowers is the slowdown in household savings deposit rates became soft in june as compared to the rates in april but they are not as soft as was expected by the regulator this is because small savings rates still remain elevated a correction is needed in small savings rates for better transmission of monetary policy said chief executive director ss mallikarjuna rao the transmission in lending rate was restricted merely to new loans the weighted average lending rate on outstanding rupee loans rose by 4 bps as past loans continue to be priced at high rates increased government borrowing and elevated small savings rates have rendered deposit mobilisation by banks expensive also indias consumption demand is still not a pronounced credit fuelled or leveraged demand sunil kumar sinha principal economist at india ratings and research said ahead of the third rate cut of the year the situation at the current juncture has become further complicated due to the crisis in both the banking and the nonbank sectors while banks are saddled with about 11 per cent of their loans turning bad nbfcs are struggling with solvency issues

MPHASIS LTD.,mumbai analysts are recommending a strategy to those looking to make a quick buck from tcss upcoming share buyback but investors would have to buy tcs shares from multiple demat accounts and simultaneously sell tcs stock futures if they want to make the most of the opportunity the strategy is to buy 100 shares of tcs each from five different demat accounts and hedge it by selling one lot of july futures from one account to earn a return of up to rs 1 lakh in the next twothree months according to anand rathi securities for instance if one buys 100 tcs shares from five demat accounts the total cost at fridays closing price of rs 1840 would be rs 92 lakh at the same time if he sells one lot of tcs futures at fridays closing price of rs 1845 the cost would be rs 922 lakh assuming the acceptance ratio of buyback is 50 per cent investors profit by tendering 250 shares would be rs 65000 if the tcs share price declines by 2 per cent during this period he would lose rs 9200 for the remaining 250 shares but he will gain rs 21400 from the future contract he sold so his total gain from the buyback and future contract deducting the losses from the cash market would be rs 77200 similarly if tcs price goes up by 2 per cent the investor would make a profit of rs 58800 the detailed calculations are given in the table the crucial factor for this strategy to work is one has to buy 100 shares of tcs each from five different demat accounts and tender it during the buyback process tcs board on june 15 has announced a rs 16000 crore buyback the company announced that its will buyback 762 crore shares or 199 per cent of its equity through a tender offer at a price of rs 2100 per share tcs is buying back the shares at a premium of 14 per cent to the current price of rs 1842 per share as per sebi regulations 15 per cent of the offer size ie rs 2400 crore will be reserved for small shareholders holding shares up to a value of rs 2 lakh as on the record date according to shareholding pattern as on june 3 2018 the likely acceptance ratio if all the small shareholders holding shares up to rs 2 lakh tender their shares in the buyback offer which works out to be 84 per cent that means if a retail investor tenders 100 shares the company would buy 84 shares however as most small shareholders do not take part in such offers the acceptance ratio becomes high during last years  investors who bought shares after the buyback announcement and tendered during the process have earned 47 per cent return while and returns were 35 per cent and 40 per cent respectively in the tcs buyback in february last year only 214 per cent of the outstanding shares held by shareholders holding less than 100 shares as per fy 2016 annual report were offered in the tender offer resulting in 100 per cent acceptance ratio as against theoretical acceptance ratio of 429 per cent in case every eligible small shareholder tendered their shares hence it is very likely that the acceptance ratio this time would be more than 50 per cent if not 100 per cent according to market participants,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/derivatives-strategy-on-tcs-buyback/articleshow/64627620.cms,1097.9,18-06-2018,1071.55,MPHASIS,08:49,Derivatives strategy on TCS buyback,

the indian paints industry is estimated to grow at a healthy pace of 13 per cent cagr over the next two years further the recent rationalization in the gst rates in paints could benefit the organized
