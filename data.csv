BANK OF BARODA,kotak institutional equities research sees banks showing further improvement in key metrics impairment ratios are likely to decline led by lower slippages recovery as well as high provisions for bad loans recapitalisation would result in most public banks reporting a sharp decline in net npl ratios nbfcs had a marginally better quarter than q3 as liquidity eased for retail players slowdown in auto sales and increase in incremental cost of funding will weigh on q4 performance it said banks stable performance overall kotak expects banks under its coverage to show stable operating performance though the massive recapitalisation in public banks could result in banks lowering net npl ratios by making higher provisions loan growth has been stable at 1415 percent for the quarter with better negligible pricing pressure resulting in nii growth of 21 percent treasury contribution is likely to be sharply lower qoq asset quality will show further improvement it added among banks kotak continues to maintain a positive outlook on corporate banks including icici bank and state bank of india  indusind bank would have a challenging quarter due to ilfs exposure while the focus on hdfc bank would be on revenue composition third party fees would be lower considering revision on upfronttrail fees from mutual funds yes bank would see a sharp slowdown in business growth and the commentary from the new management would be a key monitorable it said asset quality to show further improvement slippages to ease but credit costs would be high kotak feels that the unrecognised stress in corporate loans is negligible especially post ilfs crisis as risks emanating from real estate are not too high resolution through the ibc framework has slowed as several high profile cases could not reach a conclusion as anticipated earlier however progress continues outside through settlementsupgradewriteoffs etc in its note kotak says that the governments recent capital infusion program would result in these banks choosing to make aggressive provisions to bring down net npls of a few banks to 6 percent which gives them headroom to come out of pca the research firm maintains its key theme on playing the recovery for corporate banks with a positive outlook on corporate banks like sbi and icici bank indusind bank would have another quarter of high provisions stress in retail loans remains unchanged and low nbfcs a tad better according to kotak q4 was a tad better than q3 with improved liquidity for most nbfcs while loan growth picked up in select segments retail housing lap etc auto finance was weak reflecting the slowdown in volumes by large oems sharp rise in incremental funding costs after september 2018 will likely reflect in lower nim for the quarter seasonal trends suggest that asset quality performance improves in q4 though strong recoveries over the last few quarters set a high base wholesale lending business continued to remain muted as many nbfcs continue to struggle on the liquidity front after the sharp rally kotak has revised rating on lic housing finance to add from buy fair value of rs 590 unchanged and muthoot finance to

maintained a robust pace of growth at 15 percent yoy compared to 1011 percent in 4qfy18 the pickup in the pace of bank credit has been driven by a sharp spike in retail loans and lending to nbfcs growth in retail loans has been driven by strong uptick in unsecured loans like credit cards and personal loans it said the pace of growth in credit cards has seen a slight dip over the last few months housing loans have seen a modest upward push to 20 percent yoy there has been a slowdown in lending towards secured products like auto and commercial vehicle financing mainly on low growth in the industry demand for commercial vehicles will likely pick pace in 1hfy20e on account of prebuying due to new bsvi norms it added the relative tightening of liquidity is resulting in an increase in the borrowing cost of alternative sources of borrowings like commercial papers and debentures this has made bank funding for nbfcs an important medium to maintain liquidity resulting in a robust growth of lending to nbfcs at 50 percent yoy in januaryfebruary 2019 corporate loan growth though muted continues to crawl upwards up 5 percent yoy in february 2019 the research firm said corporate loan growth remains muted according to kotak corporate loan growth trends were broadly unchanged during the quarter as corporate loans saw tepid 5 percent yoy growth in february 2019 as per the latest

TATA STEEL,sameet chavan the inaugural week of the new financial year kicked off higher owing to cheerful mood across the globe however this early lead could not be extended much due to lack of followup buying on the subsequent days on april 3 nifty did register a new high but it was not even by a single point and hence eventually turned out to be just a formality we saw modest profit booking after this development in the next couple of days the index finally closed below the 11700 for the week fortunately this profit booking did not extend further as we saw good traction across the board on april 5 to conclude the first week on a positive note as far as direction is concerned we are still in a strong uptrend yes in between we may see hiccups but one should not be intimidated by such declines many stocks have entered an extremely overbought territory that could lead to some cooling off and to a certain extent this is what we have seen in the last couple of days however this certainly doesnt change the trend in fact it should be considered as a healthy correction to see a sustainable rally in the nearterm we advise traders not to look for shorting opportunities rather use dips to buy into some quality propositions for this week 1172011760 needs to be watched out for it is a matter of time we would see index surpassing these levels and entering uncharted territory on the downside 11609 followed by 11593 would now be seen as key support levels for the index traders are advised to stay positive and try to identify potential candidates that have probably given decent corrections and are now gearing up for the next leg of the rally here are two stocks that could give 710 percent return in the next 1 month ultratech cement  buy ltp rs 4190 target rs 4610 stop loss rs 3975 upside 10 percent cement stocks were on a roll on april 5 ultratech after forming a base around 89ema for the last two weeks has broken out from of its recent consolidation confirming a bullish breakout on the daily chart the stock prices have confirmed a bullish reversal pattern known as inverse head and shoulder the said pattern breakout has come with double of its average daily volume considering the evidence we recommend buying at current levels for a target of rs 4610 and the stop loss should be fixed at rs 3975 tata steel  buy ltp rs 549 target rs 590 stop loss rs 526 upside 7 percent we have been contradictory buyers in the metal space since the beginning of february series and tata steel has been our preferred pick from the space in the last month and a half this marquee name within this universe has already given more than 20 percent return but still we continue with our optimistic stance and from here on we expect further gains technically speaking we have witnessed a fresh breakout in the counter after struggling around 200day sma for nearly 45 days with april 5 strong bump up the stock prices have traversed this hurdle along with a substantial rise in volume thus we recommend buying at current levels for a target of rs 590 and the stop loss should be fixed at rs 526 the author is chief analyst technical  derivatives angel broking,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/podcast-stock-picks-of-the-day-heres-why-tata-steel-and-ultratech-cement-are-a-buy-3777991.html,549.05,08-04-2019,549.3,TATASTEEL,08:14,Podcast | Stock picks of the day: Here's why Tata Steel and Ultratech Cement are a buy,

TATA STEEL,which set of stocks give you healthy cash levels attractive valuations good dividend yields decent return ratios significant competitive advantages and the absence of promoter risks if you answered psu stocks thats correct psu scrips have typically attracted those seeking value despite their huge appeal they have often turned out to be wealth destroyers total returns from 44 listed nonbank psu stocks were a mere 3 percent annual growth over the last five years while the metrics may seem attractive the returns call for caution there are good reasons for their shares underperforming between fiscal 2014 and 2018 the companies in this study delivered a mere 15 percent revenue growth and 07 percent net profit growth annually the value mirage thats why investors should get not carried away by low valuations for instance steel authority of india or sail in march 2014 was at around rs 56 a share available at 06 times its book value against its historical average of 112 times that may have been inviting but today even at 06 times its book value sail remains cheap at rs 51 a share a buyer in 2014 would be sitting on losses even today sail is not alone several psus including coal india  bhel  gail india  hpcl  bpcl and many others where investors got attracted to valuations have actually turned out to be socalled value traps in the absence of earnings growth on paper psu stocks have turned cheap the psus studied are trading at an average of 11 times their earnings in fy18 against 16 times in fy15 their price to book value of 14 times is 30 basis points lower than their fy15 levels they can at best be valued based on dividends investors who take the plunge do so based on other factors such as a potential recovery in earnings and cash flows and often end up regretting it an interesting case is that of ntpc which is struggling to grow earnings since returns are regulated investors prefer to value it based on dividends during fiscal 201418 it reported 25 percent annual revenue growth whereas profit declined by 3 percent annually investors who had applied earningsbased valuation methods thinking someday these stocks will be valued as growth stocks made a mistake even today despite attractive valuations it continues to offer a 38 percent dividend yield slow growth trajectory a chief cause of wealth destruction in psu stocks is growth or the lack of it of the 44 listed psus covered here half reported a decline in revenues over the past four fiscals these companies dragged down overall annual revenue growth on an aggregate basis to merely 15 percent what about the remaining half that saw revenues grow their aggregate sales rose by 88 percent annually on average in the past four fiscals consider the performance of three leading psu miners nmdc moil and coal india despite a monopoly position and good demand from user industries miners reported a decline in profits led by reasons such as higher employee cost and inability to scale business scalability is a big constraint due to delays in decision making and inadequate planning for instance nmdc decided it will also make steel in addition to mining iron ore which fuelled investor expectation but delays and a change in plans has now resulted in the company deciding to exit this project in 2013 sail had plans to double its 13milliontonne capacity in two to three years in fiscal 2014 out of rs 60000 crore fixed capital employed in the business rs 33000 crore was tied to these expansion projects shown as capital work in progress because of the huge delays in the expansion it not only weakened its balance sheet but allowed others such as tata steel and jsw steel to increase their market share companies with a monopoly find their profits are protected even if they cannot scale up once the market opens up as was seen in the case of bhel and mtnl competition erodes their market position and share valuations managerial ability is underwhelming often growth and scalability have suffered because of the ability of management to put in perspective between fy14 and fy18 bhels net profit declined 30 percent annually and net worth by close to a percent annually as a result of drying market opportunities in the power equipment market accounted for close to 80 percent of its revenue while peers survive bhel lost on strategic thinking and initiatives in one of the reports prepared by comptroller and auditor general of india cag last year titled competitiveness of bhel in emerging markets it cited reasons such as lack of timely diversification for the poor financial performance ignoring the tenets of wealth creation poor capital allocation and reluctance to return surplus cash to shareholders has also marred the prospects of psus companies in our study have consistently kept cash and investments to the tune of 3240 percent of the equity capital invested in the business which is quite high resulting in low return ratios and eroding capital while companies during fiscal 201418 delivered 15 percent annual revenue growth their other income has risen by 75 percent annually thus profit growth to an extent has been helped by growth in other income still funds in the bank yield less than returns generated in their core business investors also fear misallocation of funds such as in the case of coal india investing surplus cash for operating power generation plants in sum public sector shares may seem like low hanging fruits but they are likely to leave a bitter aftertaste follow

TATA STEEL,when paresh shah bought shares of tata steel  he had done so with a lot of conviction that the stock would eventually move up however after six months he found that despite all the pep talk from his broker and the rosy picture painted by analysts the stock was still trading below his purchase price what is more concerning is the fact that the stock was not even showing signs of momentum what can paresh do at this point in time frankly that is not too complicated tata steel represents a solid business from a reputed business group and has rewarded investors in the past paresh himself is convinced that the stock is a good investment and is willing to wait but waiting has a cost and that cost is in the form of lost opportunities can paresh make his investment productive in such a way that he at least earns some money even as he holds the stock of tata steel the answer could be a covered call but what exactly is a covered call strategy a covered call is a simple hybrid strategy of selling higher call options when you buy a call you get a right to buy without the obligation but when you sell a call you get the obligation to sell the stock without the right let us now get back to our illustration on tata steel paresh had bought tata steel at a price of rs 530 currently the stock is quoting at lets say rs 502 while it is a notional loss his funds have been locked up in tata steel for the last six months that is where a covered call would have helped in a covered call the investor holds on to the cash position in tata steel but keeps selling higher strike call options this is how a covered call strategy will look like when the spot price is rs 502 cash market trade call option trade buy tata steel 1061 shares at rs 530 sell 1 lot 530 strike call at rs 950 now there are three possible price outcomes in the above case  if the stock price remains below rs 530 then the entire option premium of rs 950 will come into pareshs account and reduce his cost of tata steel to rs 52050  if the stock price goes sharply lower then paresh still earns the premium of rs 950 but the notional loss on tata steel widens that is not a comfortable situation  if the stock price goes up to rs 560 then there is a loss on the short call but since he is long on the cash market position he has nothing much to really worry about using covered call to consistently reduce your cost of holding the stock in fact this is where the real power of a covered call is realised if the view is that tata steel will not breach above the rs 530 mark then each month paresh can earn the premium by selling the higher call since the option expires on the last thursday of the month each month he will have to write a fresh short call does that mean each month he will make a profit on the call not exactly in some months the price movement may not favour and paresh will have to book a loss let us look at a practical scenario of how this strategy will work over a period of six months where some months are good and some are bad the table below captures how the covered call would have panned out in the last 6 months by consistently selling higher calls for six months paresh would have made rs 1725 as net profit on selling calls that effectively reduces his cost of holding tata steel from rs 530 to rs 51275 at the current market price of rs 502 your mtm loss now looks a lot more justifiable that is the advantage that you get from a covered call strategy two very important precautions needed in a covered call while a covered call is a great strategy to reduce your cost and put your investment to work there are two important things that you need to keep in mind a some traders buy futures on the stock instead of a cash market position the risk is that if the stock price falls sharply then your call has limited profit but your mtm losses on the futures can mount b at no point should this strategy be closed as a single leg for example if the price goes up dont book profits on the cash market position and hold the short call you are not hedged and your losses can mount rapidly covered calls are simple to use and easy to understand in a volatile market like india these covered calls can be a good bet at least on predictable stocks with inherent strengths the author is chief analyst  technical  derivatives  angel broking,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/covered-calls-reduce-cost-holding-stock-4083801.html,492.5,11-06-2019,486.05,TATASTEEL,12:40,Here's how to use covered calls to reduce cost of holding a stock,

TATA STEEL,from an investment perspective if the market resumes the uptrend hereon then the midcap space has a higher probability of outperforming the largecap space in next few months ruchit jain equity technical analyst angel broking ltd said in an interview with moneycontrols kshitij anand edited excerpts q sensex and nifty have fallen massively in may what should investors do now ahead of election results a after registering an alltime high of around 11850 nifty has seen a corrective phase in the last couple of weeks however if we look at some of the recent historical data it is seen that the index had shown an impulsive up move from late february to april 2019 the recent correction which is mainly on the back of the meltdown seen in global markets seems to be retracing the previous up move and looks like just a corrective phase of the uptrend the retracement supports are placed around 1122011070 also the 200dma on nifty is placed around the second support mentioned above hence an investor should use this dip as a buying opportunity and expect a resumption of the uptrend soon q do you think the equity market is pricing an adverse outcome in the upcoming election results a the recent up move in late february started after the balakot airstrike that was conducted by the indian air force this seemed to be a huge advantage to the existing government and things seemed to have changed in favour of bjp which also lifted the sentiments of market participants however the recent correction is mainly led by the weakness in global markets on mounting fear of an adverse outcome of the trade talks between the us and china hence we believe that in spite of the correction markets have not priced adverse outcome and participants are still expecting the election results to be in favour of the existing government q given that fiis have withdrawn nearly rs 2800 crore from indian equity markets in may how do you see their strategy a in the last three months fiis had poured in significant liquidity and had bought equities worth more than rs 58000 crore so the selloff figure in this month so far does not seem to be a concern as of now as far as their position in fo is concerned they had rolled over their long positions in the may series and their longshort ratio in index futures at the start of this series was around 75 percent in this series they have exited some of their long positions and created some short positions as well due to this their longshort ratio now stands around 58 percent although they have reduced some of their long positions there are no signs of concern as the ratio still stands above 50 percent q considerable selling was seen in oil  gas and metals should investors avoid these two sectors as of now a within the oil  gas space we have witnessed some stock specific momentum in the last few days the index heavyweight reliance industries has corrected from its highs whereas ongc has managed to outperform the broader markets the higher degree trend still continues to be positive and hence investors could use this decline to buy heavyweight such as reliance industries which is also approaching its 200dma support around rs 1210 on the other hand the metal index has corrected led by the heavyweight tata steel which corrected sharply on may 10 until we see any signs of reversal one can avoid bottom fishing in this sector q does it make sense to invest in beatendown midcaps if someone is looking at a time horizon of five years or so a if we look at the weekly charts then the midcap index seems to be more attractive technically than the benchmark index the nifty midcap index had shown a price wise correction in the calendar year 2018 while it has consolidated in a range in this year so far so it seems that the pricewise correction is already done and now the timewise correction may also be in its last phase the 200sma on the weekly chart has acted as strong support in the recent past as well which is placed around 16500 so from an investment perspective if the market resumes the uptrend hereon then the midcap space has a higher probability of outperforming the largecap space in the next few months this view will negate only if the nifty midcap 100 breaches 16000,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/midcaps-likely-to-outperform-nifty-if-market-resumes-uptrend-in-next-few-months-3961751.html,NA,12-05-2019,NA,TATASTEEL,13:58,'Midcaps likely to outperform Nifty if market resumes uptrend in next few months',
TATA STEEL,foreign institutional investors fiis increased their ownership of bse200 companies marginally in the march quarter fiis bought equities worth rs 46900 crore in the quarter ended march 2019 taking their ownership to 241 percent compared to 236 percent in the december quarter fiis increased their exposure in banks diversified financials insurance and oil gas and consumable fuels while they reduced their exposure in automobiles metals capital goods consumer staples and consumer durables according to a report by kotak institutional equities however there 10 stocks in the bse 200 index in which are still underowned in terms of fii ownership they include itc  lt  sbi  hindustan unilever  tata steel  asian paints  ongc  sun pharma  bajaj finserv and ntpc  experts are of the view that investors should not worry too much on underownership of stocks by fiis as many times it offers potential opportunity for them to top up and increase exposure in them in the future the reasons for underownership could differ across sectors and stocks based on fundamentals sector view and potential earnings growth of individual companies in some cases like sbi lt and bajaj finserv the business prospects seem to be improving and hence they are hitting record highs rusmik oza head of fundamental research at kotak securities told moneycontrol the right way to look at stocks would be their valuations and scope of rerating in them many long only fiis avoid investing in psu stocks because of the frequent dilution in equity hence their ownership could be lower in most psu stocks due to this approach he said table 1 10 stocks with very low ownership by fiis domestic institutional investors diis holding in the bse 200 index declined to 135 percent in the march quarter from 139 percent in the december quarter kotak institutional equities said in a report domestic fund managers added stake in banks capital goods oil  gas consumer staples insurance and hotels stocks while decreasing in diversifies financial services pharma automobiles and telecommunications there are about 10 bluechip stocks that are underowned by fund managers this includes ril  hdfc  tcs  hdfc bank  hul itc indusind bank  asian paints bajaj auto and bharti infratel  table 2 10 stocks with very low ownership by diis mutual funds performance is monitored and benchmarked to the indices on regular periodicity hence they need to consistently churn and try to provide certain alpha over and above the benchmark say experts in the base case fund managers usually churn out of stocks that are quoting at high valuations or where the upside remains fairly limited to generate alpha we saw a large up move in nifty stocks in this year so far that could have been missed by all those who were not holding these blue chips in their portfolio abhijeet bajpai cofounder  ceo avighna trades told moneycontrol valuations for near to midterm are not so attractive in nifty stocks when compared to stocks outside nifty so that might be the reason for mfs staying away from these stocks he said factors to watch underownership of stocks could be used as one method to filter stocks that might be trading at a premium when compared to historical averages at the same time dont ignore the fundamentals study the signs why the stocks have come off from highs or are now in the underowned by fpis or mutual fund managers investors should ignore the factors that are impacting the market for shortterm like elections or uschina trade talks which infused volatility the basic premise for an investor is to buy low and sell high and they should evaluate the valuation of stock for a longterm basis suggest experts investors must look at the fundamentals of a company before investing their hardearned money into stocks a companys operational efficiency top and bottom line growth margins working capital requirements return ratios and debt to equity ratio are some basic factors to check umesh mehta head of research samco securities told moneycontrol to add to it an investor must research if the promoters of a company are efficient at running the business and there are no corporate governance issues clouding the company furthermore valuations will also enable investors to decide if the fair value matches the market price he said note the above report is for information only and not generally buy

TATA STEEL,exit polls suggest continuity of a stable government at the centrea positive sign for longterm investors any dips ahead should be used as a buying opportunity according to an exit poll conducted by network 18ipsos bjpled nda is likely to gather over 336 seats republiccvoter sees bjp hitting 287 while congress gaining about 128 seats experts feel that anything above 270 for bjp on may 23 will be positive for markets although some of the good news is already discounted by the market hence profit booking is likely once the initial euphoria wanes in the past five elections barring the shortterm correction immediately after the result outcome the inherent trend of the market has remained intact umesh mehta head of research samco securities told moneycontrol therefore investors should not rejig their portfolio post elections and if they have conviction in the quality of the stock should hold on to it as fruits of patience are always sweet he said we have collated a list of

buying tata consultancy services  we believe tcs will outperform industry growth rate and will continue to gain market share the management is quite confident of posting doubledigit growth in the foreseeable future however the margin may remain under pressure in the nearterm there are some macro concerns in the us which will put some pressure on the stock in the near future however we are

consumer durables and lifestyle financier in india and has been continuously gaining market share in these businesses continuous market share gain and strong distribution have created entry barriers for competitors one of the key strengths that bajaj finance has built over time is a quick turnaround time which is unmatched by most other retail financiers thus other than purchases on credit cards of banks there are very few other competitors that bajaj finance sees in the consumer durables business which provides it with pricing power it is also diversifying successfully into personal loans

TATA STEEL,in a mail to employees in december just before the new year tata sons chairman n chandrasekaran remarked our job is to run our marathon  not to be distracted by somebody elses sprint of all the tata group companies the statement may hold true the most for tata steel  the steelmaker has given way to jsw steel  which has now emerged the largest steelmaker in india the sajjan jindal company has been aggressive  like a sprinter  in adding capacity in the domestic market and also picked up two companies through the insolvency courts it is not known if the change in the pecking order bothered chandra as the tata sons chairman is called but he will take heart from the steps that tata steel has taken in its overseas operations the steelmakers proposed joint venture in europe with thyssenkrupp is taking shape and it has divested 70 percent stake in its units in south east asia but even as the sale of these assets will help tata steel refocus its resources in the domestic market chandra knows there is more the steelmaker needs to do when it comes to his three s philosophy the 3 s stand for simplification synergy and scale for instance tata steel has almost 300 subsidiaries and associate companies clearing this web will be important also once it is nimble can the steelmaker  the third largest company in the tata group  scale up and get back its crown from jsw steel in the indian steel marathon this is one of the many questions investors will seek to find answers to as chandrasekaran completes two years at the helm of tata sons many of the queries that tata steel faces get repeated in other group companies it is still work in progress for chandra for instance much of the shareholder value still comes from tata consultancy services  says shriram subramanian of ingovern research a proxy advisory and corporate governance firm in fact the dependence on the it giant which makes up for threefourths of the groups market capitalisation has increased in the last two years all the more because of tata motors  which has shed half of its market capitalisation in the last one year the company reported a net loss of rs 26961 crore  probably the biggest for an indian company  in the third quarter of this financial year that the loss was due to the pain points in jlr is a new headache for chandrasekaran these are not minor niggles and a marathoner himself chandra knows the importance of overcoming these discomforts before they blow up into major injuries that can force a runner off the roads setting a foundation in his first year chandra did well to steer the group away from the controversies that raged after his predecessor cyrus mistry was ousted from bombay house the headquarters he sold off the loss making consumer mobile business to bharti airtel carried on the restructuring of tata steel europe  which took off under mistry  and made critical human resource tweaks he brought in talent from outside and rejigged leadership at important group companies but since then how much has the tata group progressed on the three sled one tata vision that he had laid out in december 2017 the group still has over 100 companies if there has been a simplification of this structure it is not visible yet says a former senior executive from the group reports say work on bringing down the number of subsidiaries in group companies has started while it will be a timeconsuming process the tougher one would be to bring synergy among the companies it is not easy to have synergy in the tata group as each company is a separate entity with its own independent board it would have been possible if these were subsidiaries while the three s sound good they can be superficial says nirmalya kumar former tata sons director and now lee kong chian professor of marketing at singapore management university and distinguished fellow at insead chandra has got the man to drive the synergy efforts hiring shane fitzsimons a former ge executive as the group synergy officer and one of the first attempts seems to be in the form of electric vehicles where tata motors has joined hands with tata capital and tata power while chandra had pointed out that similar programs have been put in motion investors will be keenly looking for end results aviation dreams its no secret that chandra enjoys the backing of tata trust and its chairman ratan tata at the same time he has to create a space for himself it will be critical that he is able to convince the trusts of his decisions said the former tata executive quoted above tata trusts is the biggest shareholder in tata sons and has an overarching influence over the whole group but when it came to jet airways  acquisition which sources say chandra was keen on he may have not got the backing of tata trusts the acquisition would have enabled the group to scale its aviation interest which at present revolves around vistara and airasia india aviation is a difficult market chandra has to either scale and make it profitable or sell it but can he do that jet airways would have been an important acquisition for him adds kumar who exited the group soon after mistry the jet airways acquisition would have been a tough call which is something chandra will have to deliver going forward especially given the omnipresence of ratan tata says kumar digging deeper  a suitor for the maharaja updates
