per cent fibonacci retracement ideally rs 89 the 200 dma level can be set as the target with a stop loss placed below rs 75 the selling spree is showing several signs of losing steam and a reversal attempt is in play supported by positive oscillators ideally this should stretch beyond rs 115 but a limited upside view with rs 107 as an objective looks better with a stop loss placed below rs 97

strength and potential to carry on the momentum still further upside the rsi has recently indicated a trend reversal and has signalled a buy and with good volume participation witnessed we recommend a

has witnessed a bounce back to indicate strength and the revival is anticipated to continue still further upside the chart looks attractive and with the indicators looking favourable and with good consistent volume activity witnessed we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of rs 1720 keeping a stop loss at rs 1480 parekh said this counter is displaying a lot of strength as it registered two positive closes when the entire market was under fire in last two sessions besides its closing price is almost flat around rs 188 in last three weeks on the weekly chart this is clearly pointing out that bulls are reluctant to give up their bets on this counter for reasons best known to them hence on a pull back its initial targets can be rs 203 positional traders should buy into this counter with a stop below rs 185 on closing basis mohammad said bhartis chart is looking quite interesting as it is moving almost flat in a narrow range of 295  282 levels for last seven sessions that too after a vertical fall from the highs of rs 397 for last five weeks this kind of price behaviour may be suggesting that selling might have dried up and hence a relief can be expected as long as this counter sustains above rs 282 positional traders should buy into this counter for a target of rs 325 with a stop below rs 279 on closing basis mohammad said after witnessing a sharp weakness in the month of september 2018 the stock price has shifted into a smart upside bounce in the last couple of weeks a decent bounce in last few sessions is indicating a nearterm bottom reversal for the

loss at rs 154 shetti said the downtrend in this metal stock seems to have completed after showing a bullish hammer type candlestick pattern in the previous week the stock price has witnessed a sharp upside bounce in last week this pattern is signalling an upside reversal in the stock price we also observe a formation of higher bottom formation at rs 265 compared with the last bottom of july 2018
