"Mutual fund advisors are inundated with calls from their clients, especially debt mutual fund investors, these days. According to these advisors, debt mutual fund investors are jittery about a slew of bad news that have hit the debt mutual fund space lately, and they want to sell their debt mutual fund investments.,,""Investors are scared after a series of ,. They just want to move out of , till things get normal. An NRI client called me yesterday and told me to redeem every single penny, another investor who recently invested in the credit risk fund of a big AMC called to say that he wants to get out of that fund,"" says Jitendra Solanki, founder, JS Financial Advisors.,,It all started with IL&FS fiasco, where many debt mutual funds faced default. Next was trouble of ,, followed by , Group of companies, and companies associated with Reliance Capital. Latest in line is ,. Some mutual fund houses rolled over their FMPs and some allowed only part redemption to tide over the bad situation, shattering investor's confidence about the safety of debt mutual fund schemes. Downgrades and possible defaults are still keeping many debt mutual fund investors in tenterhooks.,,In short, yes, your debt mutual funds are or may be in trouble. What can you do to salvage the situation?,,Mutual fund advisors put up a brave front. They say investors should understand that the things are not that bad as they appear. They are trying to calm their clients by pointing out that the total bad exposure of , to the downgraded securities as a percentage to the total debt funds AUM is very small.,,“Look at the debt mutual funds’ total exposure to IL&FS, ,, Reliance group companies and now Yes Bank, and divide it with total debt AUM, the exposure comes out to be much below one per cent, says Joydeep sen, founder, wiseinvestor.in . “Instead of panicking, investors should take a look at their debt mutual fund portfolio,” he adds.,,,,,Mutual fund advisors say investors can consider selling their debt mutual funds if they are extremely uncomfortable with the current situation. “If you are disturbed by your existing positions, you can take a call on your investments. You can discuss with your advisors and exit instead of panicking. DIY investors can also check the portfolio of their schemes invested, check the concentration to the downgraded securities and decide whether they want to continue or exit,” says Sen.,,Many investors erroneously used to believe that debt mutual funds are totally safe. Even those who were aware of a slew of risks associated with debt mutual funds such as interest rate risk, credit risk, etc never took them seriously. However, these investors are facing the reality after the recent setbacks. They are not sure whether they want to take the extra risk to earn an extra per cent return or better post-tax returns.,,Mutual fund advisors say the first step for these investors to take is looking at their debt mutual funds closely and find out the kind of schemes they have invested in and the possible risks associated with those schemes.,,“After the categorisation exercise by Sebi, it has become very easy for investors to understand the kind of risk involved in the schemes. Investors should look at their schemes and understand the investment strategy and risks involved. This they can do by checking the portfolio of the scheme,” says Shweta Jain, founder, Investography.,,Next, identify debt schemes that might cause trouble for you. For example, some FMPs may be in toruble, but you can't do much about it until they are up for maturity. So, you can only wait and watch.,,Solanki says “those invested in the schemes of large AMCs can stay put as these AMCs have been through various ups and downs and hold a rich experience. We know these AMCs."" However, he says he has been asking investors in mid-sized AMCs with high exposure to the troubled papers to exit their investments. ,,As for investors in credit risk funds, the category that has been facing the maximum heat, advisors are asking investors be mindful of the risk associated with these schemes. They say many investors got into these schemes without paying much attention to the higher risk in them. A scheme that is mandated to invest in lower-rated papers would obviously have high risk. Due to the current situation the risk is obvious to every investor.,,Mutual fund advisors say apart from credit risk funds, other debt mutual funds can also be risky. They say the level of risk will depend on the exposure to the low rated papers.,,“Apart from credit risk funds, other debt funds also take credit calls. Sebi does not specify credit exposure in the other debt fund categories like short duration, ultra short duration, etc. These categories can take credit calls at the discretion of the fund manager. Investors can check the exposure by checking the scheme's portfolio,” says Sen.,,",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/your-debt-mutual-funds-may-be-in-trouble-what-can-you-do/articleshow/69267888.cms,"May 10, 2019, 03.55 PM IST",Your debt mutual funds may be in trouble.

"MUMBAI: IL&FS Investment Managers Ltd or ,, the private equity arm of local infrastructure financier Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd or IL&FS, will raise roughly $1 billion (Rs 6,000 crore) from primarily overseas investors to invest in roads, ports, power and real estate developers besides other companies as it exhausts funds raised in the three verticals., , India’s largest listed private equity fund, which invested $3.2 billion in infrastructure companies, real estate and other ventures from city gas distribution to retail and media, has started discussions with its overseas investors and could complete the fund raising by December from pension and endowment funds apart from family offices., , ""As of date we have deployed everything, made substantial divestment and have to exit another $1.8 billion,"" said Archana Hingorani, chief executive officer and executive director, ILFS IML. ""Funds across all three verticals are largely deployed and at different stages of maturity with some of them in exit mode while some assets are being developed."", , The three verticals the , fund operates in are traditional private equity, infrastructure and real estate. Hingorani did not comment on how much fresh money she will raise as the listed company is in a silent period ahead of results. The PE fund had raised $500 million in 2010., , PE funds face challenges when it comes to raising money despite overseas investors pumping in $16 billion since December to buy shares on bourses., , Between 2010 and July 2014, 96 PE funds have raised $15.88 billion to invest in Indian companies, according to ,, a PE data tracker., , ""From a private equity perspective, which is a much longer time horizon investment, confidence to reinvest in India is still to build up,"" said Hingorani, who has been at the helm of the fund for the past six years. ""Although there is interest, the crossover of believing that India will generate interesting returns is yet to happen."", , Returns for investors in PE funds, or limited partners in industry parlance, have been declining in the past decade after those that invested before 2005 delivered 25% returns. Funds that invested at around the time of the global crisis haven’t done as well with the Indian economy slowing, lack of policy reform and the rupee weakening to 60 against the dollar., , ""In the last three-four years, even for the better transactions which have netted between 20% and 22% returns, the money returned in dollar terms has not been attractive,"" said Hingorani, whose listed fund has given dividends to its shareholders for the past decade. ""For these set of investors to be convinced to come back is going to take some time and the experience of the last five years weighs heavily as against the potential to do better going forward."", , ILFS IML exited 23 investments for Rs 970 crore in fiscal year 2014 at a multiple of 1.8 and in fiscal 2013 it exited for Rs 540 crore., , Peers agree about the challenges when it comes to raising funds. ""For new private equity fund commitments, I think it will take time before investors really increase their India allocations,"" said Pawan Singh, managing director, India and Southeast Asia, Bain Capital, which invests in Indian companies from a global fund. ""Prior to the elections, India had fallen off the radar for most investors but the sentiment change has at least put India back on the agenda… Investors are waiting to see what actions the government takes, what that translates into in terms of GDP growth, currency etc., and also what outcomes they get on their existing investments.”, , Consultants said limited partners will look at returns before they invest., , ""For existing funds, it will boil down to how much capital have you returned and what sort of returns did you make on your investments,"" said Vikram Uttam Singh, managing director, Marshal and Alvarez, a consultant. ""Until the elections, these investors were showing less and less interest in India, but now conversations have started between the fund managers and investors.""

Besides, a crippling liquidity crunch has spooked the confidence of investors and a crisis has engulfed the entire , sector. This is not the first instance when credit rating agencies have been caught slumbering in a debt market crisis.,,Market regulator , has now tightened the norms for credit rating agencies in an attempt to restore investor faith in the system. Actually, the crisis in the NBFC sectors has cascaded into the entire financial sector, threatening to disrupt the economy.,,RBI’s new circular said credit rating agencies will now have to make more disclosures about the quality of debt instruments they rate. The new guidelines require disclosures on cumulative default rates, probability of default benchmarks and liquidity indicators. Sebi has also tweaked the methodology to arrive at default rates. They now need to disclose all factors that ratings are sensitive to.,,Sebi has also proposed appointing independent director on the board of each credit rating company for a period not exceeding three years. ,,The new benchmark, ‘Probability of Default’, will be used for both short- and long-term instruments. Sebi says rating agencies need to disclose on their websites by December 31 one-year, two-year and three-year cumulative default rates for each rating category.,,If there is an explicit credit enhancement, the credit rating agencies will assign a ‘CE’ suffix to a rating. The raters will also have to evaluate whether a credit enhancement structure is sufficient, under various scenarios, including stress, and disclose it in ratings press releases.,,The new regulation also states that in consultation with Sebi, the rating agencies will need to frame uniform standard operating procedures (SOP) to track debt defaults and their timely recognition. ,,For liquidity Indicators, Sebi has made it mandatory for the rating agencies to publish a standardised liquidity indicator, indicating poor, stretched, or adequate to superior/strong classifications.,,These steps will not only bring transparency in the system but also align our rating agencies with globally followed standards, especially in terms of rating methodology. This, in turn, should help reinforce confidence among investors.,,The changes will bring in the much-needed transparency in the system, help investors make more informed decisions and give them global-level play. Enhanced disclosures will give investors more clarity on the rated companies.

"MUMBAI: Troubled infrastructure finance conglomerate IL&FS is seeking government and regulatory intervention after its key shareholders didn’t offer an immediate credit facility to stave off mounting debt defaults and a potential bankruptcy.,,The IL&FS management is writing to the finance ministry and the RBI about a looming crisis in the Mumbaibased group with nearly Rs 1 lakh crore of public debt, people directly aware of the matter said. IL&FS is set to default on more commercial papers and face loan recalls in the coming week after shareholders, led by LIC and SBI, during a board meeting on Saturday deferred extending a Rs 3,000 crore loan sought by the conglomerate.,,Sources said IL&FS was hoping to draw the government’s attention to avert a possible implosion of a large infrastructure builder and financier — either by the state-run shareholders extending bailout loans or by asking the state investors to snap up the group’s roads and tunnels put up for sale.,,This follows shareholders asking the unlisted IL&FS to speed up asset sales to tide over the liquidity crisis. “The shareholders said they are committed to support but didn’t decide on bridge loans sought by the besieged management,” sources said.

IL&FS has been in discussions to sell a portfolio of 26 build-operate-transfer (BOT) road projects to multiple investors like Lone Star, Isquared Capital and National Infrastructure Investment Fund (NIIF), among others. But as these discussions took time to materialise, it has also decided to sell the 4-lakh-sqft HQ at Bandra Kurla Complex in , for Rs 1,280 crore. IL&FS top brass informed shareholders that they were close to striking some monetisation deals but needed urgent loans to meet debt repayments, and to halt a gathering crisis, after it began defaulting a month ago.,,With no immediate liquidity in sight, some lenders are likely to trigger loan recalls and may even decide on taking IL&FS to the bankruptcy court. The management has reiterated that the group has recoverable capital that is more than covers its debt. It continues to hold that the net present value of assets is more than the liabilities by Rs 5,000 crore, even if all of them were to be paid off today.,,Last week, the net asset value of 25 mutual fund schemes were hit after the credit ratings agencies downgraded debt securities issued by IL&FS and its subsidiaries.,,State-run LIC is the largest shareholder owning a fourth of the conglomerate’s equity, while Orix Corporation of Japan owns 23.5%. Other shareholders include ,, HDFC, SBI and Central Bank of India.,,While the IL&FS seeks government and RBI support, the management said it has proactively worked on raising capital for several years, including a failed merger deal with billionaire ,. The management was of the view that it was necessary to get investors who were not subject to intense regulatory scrutiny like LIC, SBI and HDFC.,,LIC has proposed S B Mathur as new chairman of the debt-ridden company since Hemant Bhargava is also in the executive committee of the insurance behemoth that decides on investments.

IL&FS Investment Managers Ltd is the private equity arm of the infrastructure development and financial services group IL&FS., , “One, a variety of reasons have led to excess leverage in the sector…there is, therefore, a need to recapitalise infrastructure developers so as to enable them to regain the investment appetite, specifically in sectors like power and roads. Secondly, the economy continues to offer significant growth opportunities, many of which have got a considerable push on account of a positive government action.”, , , , The fund will focus on logistic companies that got a booster shot from the rollout of the goods and services tax and waste management companies bolstered by the government’s ‘Swachh Bharat’ push., , India’s largest listed PE fund’s fresh infrastructure fund came after it divested 24 of its 28 investments in such companies from cooking gas suppliers to power plants builders. The fund, which invested in waste management company Ramky Infrastructure, is looking to exit it now., , In addition to the equity fund, IL&FS Investment Managers is also in the final stages of negotiations with the $124.3-billion Islamic Development Bank's private investment arm ICD to raise a billion dollar debt fund to invest in Sub Saharan Africa, one of the four largest target regions for the Islamic Bank., , IL&FS will contribute a smaller amount, leaving the larger commitment to the Islamic Bank, and will be managing the fund to lend to companies which build infrastructure projects in 28 countries in Africa., , “We are collaborating with the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD) for creating a $1b debt fund to invest in the capital starved region on Africa,” Bawa said. “Relationship with ICD helps us in building a de-risked and diversified portfolio spanning transportation, utilities and social sectors.”, , “Significantly, higher exposure to debt and mezzanine instruments with a very modest equity allocation help us further mitigate risks of investing in a new region,” he added., , Consultants say IL&FS is using the debt route to reduce risk and study the market for an equity play in future. “It is interesting to see IL&FS planning to invest in Sub Saharan Africa and I would like to believe this is on the back of India and Indian companies wanting to increase engagement in that region,” said Harish HV, head, private equity, Grant Thornton, India., , “IL&FS would be able to leverage their knowledge of infrastructure to support the fund and also earn good returns from its investment. Clearly IL&FS is using the debt route to reduce risk and learn the market as possibly a preparatory exercise to do an equity play at a later date,” he added., , IL&FS PE, in partnership with Standard Chartered bank, has previously raised a $660 million infrastructure fund with Standard Chartered known as Standard Chartered IL&FS Asia Infrastructure Growth Fund, which focuses on investing in Asia market. “The current infra fund will be an India focussed fund, where the fund intends investing in roads and energy projects in the country,” said another person with knowledge of the fund's plans., , IL&FS Investment Managers has assets under management (AUM) of $3.2 billion., , The fund manager has made 163 investments across 13 funds since it started operations in 1996.

"Commentary so far on the IL&FS crisis has focused on one single fact. The systemic disruption and chaos that an IL&FS collapse would cause if it is not saved soon with fresh capital infusion. Banks would be forced to make provisions, the extent of NPAs within banks and in the system would rise and this would delay and worsen the bad-loan problem that the banking industry is grappling with. Secondly, IL&FS default has sparked mark-downs in debt held by mutual funds which is estimated at about Rs 4,000 crore. Experts fear that an increase in redemption pressures in these funds would cause chaos in the market as funds rush to dump securities at whatever prices they get. This is exactly what happened last week when DSP Mutual Fund sold some papers of , Ltd (DHFL) at 11 per cent yield, much higher than the rate at which it was first sold. Mounting fear that this discounted sale is a reflection of problems either at DHFL or DSP created panic in the markets pulling down the Sensex by nearly 1,000 points in one frenetic session. Fears that banks and mutual funds will stop lending to nonbanking finance companies pummelled shares of these companies adding to the chaos.,,Now, some of these fears are probably exaggerated as shown in Tuesday’s debt market trading. Mutual funds continue to invest in NBFCs and housing finance companies, who have come back to the market. Rates have risen a bit but that is only to be expected given the turmoil in the past 10 days. More importantly, mutual funds and banks continue to consider NBFCs as a good investment given that many top-rated ones possess stable, strong balance sheets with little sign of deterioration. If this mood and level of activity sustains, normalcy could return to debt markets in a few weeks. If IL&FS shareholders approve and decide to participate in the rights issue this weekend, the pall of gloom that had descended on markets since last week’s gyrations would be lifted. LIC chairman VK Sharma’s statement on Tuesday afternoon that all efforts would be made to save IL&FS did a lot to bring confidence back but we are yet to hear from other shareholders like , and Orix Corporation of Japan. HDFC, with about 9 per cent stake, is unlikely to participate in the issue, as the Economic Times reported some weeks back.,,,The big problem, however, is not with just saving IL&FS. While it would require large amounts of capital and pit LIC at the forefront of yet another rescue mission after IDBI, finding a few thousand crore among some of the biggest institutions in the world and India is not difficult. Fixing accountability and responsibility at IL&FS top management is also not difficult if the shareholders want it that way.,,But that is only going to solve the shortterm problem. There still remains a bigger issue and it is this: What does this episode do to infrastructure financing and funding in India? What does the IL&FS example mean to promoters of infrastructure companies looking to raise fundsRs And for banks and investors looking to invest in them?,,Whether one likes it or not, IL&FS has become a poster child of reckless infrastructure investment. A series of defaults, nearly Rs 90,000 crore in debt, a tonedeaf management that has allowed this situation to persist, IL&FS has become a symbol of everything that is wrong in infrastructure in the country. The management may blame governments and local authorities and they could be partly right as well, but that does not still answer how a situation like this was allowed to persist for so many years without any attempt at redressal.,,This may not be a canary in the coal mine, but yesterday’s failure of North Eastern Electric Power Corp bond issue tells you exactly where investors stand vis-a-vis power and infrastructure investments. The issue was supposed to raise Rs 300 crore, but it got only one bid and guess what was that amount? Rs 13 crore! What makes this all the more ominous is that NEEPCO is a government utility and has sovereign backing. Yet investors were not willing to give money.,,Private sector bankers are very clear about what they want to do. Increase retail book, reduce corporate book and unless there are exceptional circumstances, avoid infrastructure lending. Avoid lending in cases where a project requires massive land buying, complex environmental approvals and depends on fuel and other raw material linkages from the government. The massive pile-up in bad loans, caused in many cases by infrastructure and metal investment, the struggles promoters/entrepreneurs to get basic approvals and changed business environment for power means both promoters and bankers are increasingly reluctant to consider infrastructure as a top investment priority.,, CEO Aditya Puri said at a recent ET event that banks would still be willing to fund projects if they are sound and have necessary approvals. “Please don’t forget that we are lending not our money but your money,” he said. But many other bankers are not so hopeful. , wants to increase its retail share of the asset book to nearly 60 per cent. It is already there. Other private sector banks like IndusInd, Kotak and HDFC too have an increasingly high retail share of the book. And this is only going to get worse.,,Infrastructure funding in India is probably going to be driven more by government agencies like the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) or foreign outfits like Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Private sector banks are increasingly going to sit out while public sector banks will become far more cautious. IL&FS may not have started this trend but has definitely worsened it.,,  ,",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/yes-ilfs-is-bad-news-but-not-in-the-way-you-think/articleshow/65958396.cms,"Updated: Sep 26, 2018, 06.00 PM IST","Yes, IL&FS is bad news but not in the way you think"

"BENGALURU: Mumbai-based IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company has got six more months to complete the metro work on the Mysuru Road stretch.

The exact amount of the penalty is, however, not known.,The BMRCL awarded the ₹327-crore contract to IL&FS in April 2015, setting a 27-month deadline. The contract included the construction of elevated structures (viaduct) of about 3.9-km length from Mysuru Road station to Pattanagere station, which consisted of four stations on the west extension of the East-West Corridor.,,The stations are to come up at Nayandahalli, Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Jnanabharathi and Pattanagere.,,Though the BMRCL was quick to award the contract, it failed to acquire the land required for the project on time.

At the stations, the contractor has taken up work of costing pile, pile cap, column up to concourse level and portal beam at concourse level is in progress, the newsletter said.,,The newsletter gives information on the progress of work every month. It does not, however, indicate the volume of the work remaining or the total quantum of work.,,If previous deadlines are anything to go by, after a contractor completes civil work, it takes almost a year to lay the tracks, instal signalling and telecommunication systems among others.,,BMRCL’s previous managing director Pradeep Singh Kharola, in his last interaction before he quit Namma Metro, had termed the performance of IL&FS “bad”. “The contractor was initially slow. It’s picking up now,” he had said. Another BMRCL official attributed the delay to multiple factors including the contractor’s command — or the lack of it — over its manpower.,,IL&FS has executed metro projects for ,, Gurgaon, which involved the construction of a double track elevated viaduct worth ₹256-crore and five elevated stations.

"BENGALURU: Even as IL&FS is in news over a financial crisis, its subsidiary, IL&FS Engineering & Construction Company, is showing reasonably good performance in the construction of the Mysuru Road metro stretch. The visible signs of improvement in civil work on the 3.9km corridor may help its case in closing the Outer Ring Road (ORR) metro contract. ,,“The contractor (IL&FS) was slow in the beginning. Its performance in the past three-to-four months has been fairly good,” an engineer who works for Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) told ET. Another source in the BMRCL also confirmed the progress. As on Wednesday, the civil work pertaining to two stations — Nayandahalli and RR Nagara — was nearly complete except for the entry and exit gates. Even the viaduct that starts from the Mysuru Road station to RR Nagara was ready. ,,The barricades which were put up for the construction too have been removed, leaving the entire road for vehicle movement. ,, , ,,The progress between Jnanabharati and Pattanagere stations has, however, been slow as compared to the first two stations. On some stretches, the work related to the placing of concrete segments, parapets and walkways is still going on. A lot of work such as building of columns and floors is pending at these two stations. ,,The contractor has three more months to hand over the entire 3.95km project to the BMRCL according to the agreement. “We have told them to complete the work by December end although there was a request from them to extend the deadline till March,” one of the officials quoted above said. “The work on Mysuru Road started slow but there is good progress now. On the , Road, the contractor performed well in the beginning. It’s moving slowly now,” he added. ,,It is learnt the BMRCL took the contractor (IL&FS) to task after the construction firm failed to meet its first deadline. The construction firm had ,won the Rs 332-crore project in April 2015 with a condition to complete the work in 27 months. Because the project was far from complete even by the end of 2017, the company was given a one-year extension with a penalty of Rs 1 crore. ,,“As the civil work is nearing completion, we are finalising contracts to take up architectural work of stations. It takes about six months to complete the work and simultaneously we will start laying tracks,” the officer said. ,,The progress on the remaining section of Mysuru Road, however, continues to be far from complete. , had won the Rs 332-crore project in March 2016 with the June 2018 deadline.

The work comprises constructing elevated structures and four stations at Central Silk Board, HSR Layout, Agara lake and Iblur.,,In all, six firms had submitted bids for the ORR line, which was split into three parts for speedier construction (which ET reported on May 30). During the technical rounds, the BMRCL disqualified Ahmedabad-headquartered Sadbhav Engineering “as it did not meet the tender conditions”.,,The BMRCL, official sources said, was on the verge of disqualifying IL&FS too on the grounds that the company had a weak financial record and was blacklisted by other transport corporations in India.

Wherever the management is solid, they will be able to weather this storm and come out stronger.,,Markets are more than discounting that and again remember this currency when in 2014 rupee was at 70. In 2017 it became 63 and from 63 it has gone to 72. So when you look at from 63, it looks like 12% depreciation but if I look at from 2014 level, we are up 3%, 4%. ,,,,The first thing about markets are prices, the second is earnings and all the fundamentals. So obviously when prices fall 50-55%, the first thing that we want to look for is if there is any big issue and if the issue is not that in print, then normally it is a knee-jerk reaction.,,If you have good companies, you cannot be a prisoner of prices. In the NBFC business it is always said that you have to stay with the best. If you have been buying good quality names, they have come down and you can buy more.

Nobody quite knows where the equity value of this unwieldy empire lies. The discount for that uncertainty would be large. Consider the recent rights issue, the previous management’s last-ditch attempt to infuse liquidity before it was booted out by the government last month.,, , ,Just three years ago India’s Life Insurance Corp., the largest shareholder, didn’t want to sell its stake at 750 rupees a share; now it doesn’t want to buy more at even 150 rupees a share.

That’s what I’ve recommended, and that’s the second approach the new board wants to consider.,, , ,The third strategy, of finding a buyer for each road or power plant separately, would be time-consuming. Besides, projects that are stuck awaiting land allotment, environmental clearance or financial closure would deliver better value if bundled together with others yielding stable cash flows.,,The stump that would remain would be a pure financier. Its equity interest in the offloaded businesses may have to be substantially written off. But once the operating assets start performing well under new owners, the $4.2 billion in credit the group has extended against them may have a greater chance of being repaid.

",,ILFS’s SPV entity has reportedly defaulted on the interest payments to bond holders putting to question the entire sanctity of a ring fenced SPV, with escrowed cash flows and protected interest. The SPV Entity has sighted the legal order of NCLT on ILFS and ILFS subsidiaries which restrains them from discharging their liabilities, as a reason for the SPVs also to not pay interest .,,As of now it seems more like a technical default however, it is bordering towards a wilful default. Given that the entity (SPV) has cash, a different interpretation could have been taken rather than citing the NCLAT order. Their payment to bond holders may have then been challenged by the court by other lenders of ILFS but it would have atleast meant that investor confidence remains intact.,,The bigger spill over is that it calls into question the entire concept of having an SPV as an operational entity which is separate from the parent. Many times, SPVs tend to be better rated than the parent because of their individual operations and cash generation capacity, rather than being linked to the parent company and its management.,,If a resolution does not happen it may put into question other similar structures and have a negative impact on investor confidence. Banks have significant exposures to, especially the Road Sector, through the SPV route and adverse ruling on this issue can lead to investor uncertainty, funding squeeze and the risk aversion which can spread to other segments and investors.,, who have held these ILFS SPV entities have taken a mark-down in its value and in the absence of resolution it will be forced to mark down the entire value of its holding in these SPVs. Furthermore, following the principle of fair valuation, they should prudentially mark-down other ILFS SPV entities bond that they hold. The industry will also have to look into other such investments in SPVs which have a weak parent/group as the sponsor and/or the operator of the underlying asset to consider likely defaults.,,Given the fragile investor sentiment prevailing since the ILFS/ Dewan Housing issue broke out, episodes like the current one, can further erode investor sentiment towards debt funds in general.,,We have been maintaining that Investors should prioritize Liquidity and Safety over Returns when they look to invest in Fixed Income / Debt funds.
