MPHASIS LTD.,mumbai analysts are recommending a strategy to those looking to make a quick buck from tcss upcoming share buyback but investors would have to buy tcs shares from multiple demat accounts and simultaneously sell tcs stock futures if they want to make the most of the opportunity the strategy is to buy 100 shares of tcs each from five different demat accounts and hedge it by selling one lot of july futures from one account to earn a return of up to rs 1 lakh in the next twothree months according to anand rathi securities for instance if one buys 100 tcs shares from five demat accounts the total cost at fridays closing price of rs 1840 would be rs 92 lakh at the same time if he sells one lot of tcs futures at fridays closing price of rs 1845 the cost would be rs 922 lakh assuming the acceptance ratio of buyback is 50 per cent investors profit by tendering 250 shares would be rs 65000 if the tcs share price declines by 2 per cent during this period he would lose rs 9200 for the remaining 250 shares but he will gain rs 21400 from the future contract he sold so his total gain from the buyback and future contract deducting the losses from the cash market would be rs 77200 similarly if tcs price goes up by 2 per cent the investor would make a profit of rs 58800 the detailed calculations are given in the table the crucial factor for this strategy to work is one has to buy 100 shares of tcs each from five different demat accounts and tender it during the buyback process tcs board on june 15 has announced a rs 16000 crore buyback the company announced that its will buyback 762 crore shares or 199 per cent of its equity through a tender offer at a price of rs 2100 per share tcs is buying back the shares at a premium of 14 per cent to the current price of rs 1842 per share as per sebi regulations 15 per cent of the offer size ie rs 2400 crore will be reserved for small shareholders holding shares up to a value of rs 2 lakh as on the record date according to shareholding pattern as on june 3 2018 the likely acceptance ratio if all the small shareholders holding shares up to rs 2 lakh tender their shares in the buyback offer which works out to be 84 per cent that means if a retail investor tenders 100 shares the company would buy 84 shares however as most small shareholders do not take part in such offers the acceptance ratio becomes high during last years  investors who bought shares after the buyback announcement and tendered during the process have earned 47 per cent return while and returns were 35 per cent and 40 per cent respectively in the tcs buyback in february last year only 214 per cent of the outstanding shares held by shareholders holding less than 100 shares as per fy 2016 annual report were offered in the tender offer resulting in 100 per cent acceptance ratio as against theoretical acceptance ratio of 429 per cent in case every eligible small shareholder tendered their shares hence it is very likely that the acceptance ratio this time would be more than 50 per cent if not 100 per cent according to market participants,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/derivatives-strategy-on-tcs-buyback/articleshow/64627620.cms,1097.9,18-06-2018,1071.55,MPHASIS,08:49,Derivatives strategy on TCS buyback,

cent of the companys shares  changed its strategy on margins it was also the year when it was hit by a serious bribery scandal in india it appears that these issues became too much to handle for former ceo francisco dsouza and his team that had led the company through those years of searing growth cognizant always had much lower margins than indian peers tcs and infosys it said this was because it was investing more in the business and it was this investment that enabled it to grow so fast sometime in 20152016 it decided it must raise margins in august 2017 in an interaction with toi dsouza said we thought it was very important to shift the focus of the company and our messaging and value proposition to investors from industry leading growth to high quality sustainable growth we have reached a point now where we think it is important not just to be focused on growth for the sake of growth and to really be thoughtful about what are the growth opportunities to go after and how we go after them so that the growth is sustainable longer elliott he indicated had suggested an acceleration of this move a letter elliott wrote in 2016 said its value enhancement plan calls for a 23 per cent adjusted operating margin in 2018 compared to a 197 per cent margin in 2015 bert hochfeld ceo of ticker target investments told toi last year that elliott got involved in cognizant because the company was not being well run but elliotts plan didnt mesh well with the culture at cognizant he said and they were unable to do what they needed to do i am not sure that elliott had some specific knowledgeunderstanding that its strategy would challenge the growth potential of cognizant although that might be the case but i have watched elliott for some years and their propensity to

WIPRO,the grass is always greener on the other side some analysts prefer to say the same thing about the ecommerce businesses the biggest buzz in the industry lately some unlisted ecommerce names such as ani technologies ola oravel stays   and one97 communications   have been creating quite a splash in the unlisted market mainly on the strength of their titular value drawing in small and retail investors many such investors flocking to these counters are not even aware of the challenges of the unlisted space especially with regard value fluctuation and limited liquidity many are drawn to such propositions on the lure of attractive valuations and herd mentality according to abhishek securities a firm dealing in unlisted shares ola oyo rooms and paytm are currently trading at rs 27500 rs 75000 and rs 17000 respectively in the unlisted space that even when these companies continue to incur losses one 97 communications which houses the main payments business of paytm reported an over fourfold rise in consolidated revenue in fy18 at rs 33148 crore but losses swelled to rs 160605 crore from rs 90309 crore in fy17 as per data sourced from tofler meanwhile paytm mall reported a loss of rs 178755 crore on a total revenue of rs 77486 crore in fy18 as it looks to compete with walmartbacked flipkart and amazon india which together hold 80 per cent market share combined losses of one 97 and paytm mall swelled 270 per cent to rs 3393 crore in fy18 from rs 917 crore in fy17 while combined revenues went up by 417 per cent during the same period to rs 4089 crore for the year ended march 2018 oyo india reported a marginal widening of net loss to rs 360 crore for india operations against rs 355 crore loss reported for the previous financial year oyo indias revenue growth has jumped over threefold the firm reported an operating revenue of rs 416 crore for financial year 2018 compared with rs 120 crore reported for financial year 201617 flipkart india led the way with an unmatched margin net loss of the ecommerce giant grew over 700 per cent in fy18 though revenue growth during the period was 39 per cent in fy18 flipkart india reported a rs rs 2060 crore loss against rs 245 crore in the previous year what then justifies the skyhigh valuations that these stocks are commanding in the unlisted space business models in ecommerce industry in general differ from traditional businesses they do not owe or possess any tangible assets like land plant or warehouse also they incur huge losses and do not have any other reserve as well despite this their valuations keep going up to billions remember flipkart sold its controlling stake to at rs 111 lakh crore says sandip ginodia of abhishek securities dinesh gupta partner at unlisted securities explains the arithmetic of valuing an ecommerce entity ecommerce outfits are virtual shops and they are valued by their sales at 10 to 15 times of annual sales the multiple may be even higher in certain cases depending on growth stage of the segment he said fair value of any stock is very subjective till it gets listed different sets of people can value the same thing using different methods to arrive at different numbers here one sees value in something and the other does not says ginodia arun mukherjee a kolkatabased value investor and cofounder of sebiregistered sa investment advisors says there is a great fool theory at work behind the humungous valuations that these companies command that theory says it is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they are overvalued and by selling them for a profit at a later date this is because there will always be someone a bigger or greater fool willing to pay a higher price he said even the largest ecommerce company of the world amazon does not make any money ginodia points out ecommerce is a global trend which is why such a company will be valued higher even when they do not have any asset or profits since there is no structural mechanism they are inflating valuations at will ecommerce is the new trend currently but once sentiment weakens investors may rush to offload them these companies are valued only on the basis of top line and the growth they show it is very hard to arrive at fair value said ginodia gupta says when a company is not listed it does not need to focus on investors it does not opt for any mechanism like rights issue or bonus issue which may downgrade their stock value this is why any valuation is considered okay again price alone cannot be a determinant of attractiveness of a stock mrf currently trades around rs 55000 at 20 times the eps of rs 2600 this is does mean that the stock is not investorfriendly similarly if had not given any bonus or split its share the stock value would have been rs 5 lakh today they split it to ensure liquidity for investors gupta said ecommerce stocks do not see much volume in the unlisted space mostly because of high valuations if they are to be listed in the stock market the valuation will not be even 1100th of what they are demanding they are priced so high but you would still buy it thinking that some another buyer will come later on says mukherjee he said investors should be very cautious while investing in the unlisted space flipkart is making billions of losses every year you are making sales in penny but are valued in millions this is crazy there is no in it at some point these bubbles will burst for sure mukherjee said according to him indian customers fall for discounts and offers and this is what the ecommerce companies are tapping to do business but this is unlikely to continue forever they will not make any profit anytime soon perhaps next three to five years some analysts say some promoters like those of the ecommerce giants want their stocks to trade at a premium among select investors this is why companies like mrf page industries or shree cements do not opt for a stock split or bonus issues ola has slashed all discounts and will be in profit in a year or two people will be using ola as they have got used to it now at a later stage paytm may start charging a fee for its services it is active in many services which will in turn enhance revenue this is be the business model and most ecommerce companies follow the same said

ICICI BANK,the downward spiral in indias gsec yields has been fairly sharp with 10year benchmark declining to a low of 7 per cent which we last saw in 2017 the flattening of the curve has been more pronounced since the second week of may 2019 with the short end 629 per cent for 1 year declining by 35 bp compared with a 45 bp drop for the 10 year the corporate bond curve has also flattened with 5year aaa yield declining to 730 per cent and the 10year one to 8 per cent in addition to the easing of gsec yields the sharp drop in india gdp growth to 58 per cent amid easing of core cpi inflation to approximately 470 per cent has created space for a 25 bp rate easing by rbi in its june 6 announcement this flattening of yield curves has been more pronounced after the general elections and it mimics the us and global bond markets which have been impacted by the resurfacing of the uschina trade conflict leading to a relapse of growth worries the us 10year treasure yield has softened by nearly 25 bps to 214 per cent since early may 2019 and 45 bps since april the growth worries are also reflecting in the yield curve inversion in the us effective fed rate is trading at 24 per cent market expectation on feds policy stance is changing st louis fed president james bullard thinks that a downward policy rate adjustment may be warranted soon to help recentre inflation and inflation expectations at target and to provide an insurance in case of a sharperthanexpected slowdown in us economic growth notwithstanding his assessment of a strong us economy and underplaying the significance of the curve inversion jerom powell now displays openness for rate easing if trade conflicts does significant damage to us economic outlook resulting from these global and domestic developments fpi flows into indian markets have turned positive net fpi purchases in indian markets rose to 28 billion of which 2 billion came into the equity market and the balance into the debt market on a monthly basis total flows of 23 billion in may 2019 was lower when seen against the march peak of 74 billion most of which 48 billion had come into the debt market the contribution of domestic players in the recent curve flattening has been modest deployments of debt mutual funds into the gsec market have been on a decline since the end of 2017 67 per cent drop with major concentration being in money market instruments indian banking system has seen a persistent liquidity problem thanks to a rise in creditdeposit ratio to a high of 77 per cent systemic allocation into gsec has grown modestly at 35 per cent yoy as of may 2019 however the incremental allocation of rs 13 trillion year to date in fy20 has been higher than net borrowing of govt of india till date at rs 119 trillion the corresponding numbers for last year were rs 126 billion and rs 712 billion respectively easing of global yields and expectations of rate easing by rbi have resulted in significant elevation in stock valuations trailing multiple for nifty currently stands at 30 times 12month earnings which is an alltime high despite fairly weak earnings growth at around 3 per cent yoy trailing the trend of liquiditydriven multiple expansion and declining earnings growth has sustained since may 2014 thereby accentuating the bubble scenario the peg for nifty stands at a high of 6 times assuming actual mediumterm average earnings growth of 5 in contrast the midcap index has not responded to the recent liquiditydriven rally as aums of mutual funds contracted 12 per cent in april to rs 74 trillion from march 2019 level and net inflows declined to rs 46 billion nse midcap valuation at 32 times is nearly close to that of the benchmark indices last seen in 2013 the outlook for the equity market remains tricky with peak valuations for the benchmark indices which has been largely driven by fpi flows domestic funds are also aligning with them to chase largecap favourites in banking   kotak bank  sbi constructions lt consumer nbfcs bajaj finance and select it names tcs unlike the 2017 episode easing of gsec yields and rate cut expectations has not revived interest in the broader nbfc sector especially in hfcs the general expectation is that easing of rate by rbi and fiscal boost by modi government 20 will translate into better earnings growth but the efficacy of countercyclical expansionary policies to turn around growth is limited in our view given the context of multiple structural knots that the economy is entangled in it is possible that the liquiditydriven bubble may sustain for some more time but the risk of any miss especially on the reforms front can generated volatility in the foreseeable future in our view unlike the 2014 general elections when the market was cheap nifty at 16 times trailing earnings the negative performance of midcaps and smallcaps since january 2018 will keep participation of retail discretionary flows

ICICI BANK,eight years ago when dr was serving his second term as prime minister and indias retail inflation neared 9 per cent the central bank chose to have a hard look at the liquidity adjustment framework to make its rate signals more effective a panel headed by reserve bank of india executive director deepak mohanty suggested that the liquidity adjustment facility operate in a mode with the repo rate the rate at which lends to banks being the single policy rate to unambiguously signal monetary policy stance citing an example the panel said a 100 bps change in the repo causes around 80 bps change in the weighted average call rate wacr over a month however the strength of the response turns out to be relatively small in a liquidity situation in theory the job of the central bank is to anchor the overnight call money rate around the policy rate while this objective works better in developed economies it remained pretty wayward in india over the last decade keeping liquidity in deficit is easier said than done the banking system was awash with funds after demonetisation when humble savers were forced to dig out money kept under the mattresses and deposit them in banks former governor urjit patel did his bit to suck out liquidity and restore normalcy but then lost his chair for sticking to his ground on slightly deficit liquidity even after the nonbank credit crisis of 2018 antagonising the government patel had a rift with the fiscal authority on issues such as the fate of rbis excess reserves and central bank autonomy his successor shaktikanta das who initially followed the 2011 liquidity guidance has now flagged expectations of easier flow of funds setting up an internal working group that will review the existing liquidity management framework suggest measures to simplify the system and clearly communicate the objectives quantitative measures and toolkit of liquidity management the group is expected to submit its report by midjuly system liquidity was in surplus of rs 16500 crore at the end of last week vs rs 49500 crore in the previous week liquidity in the system turned into an average daily surplus in june after remaining in deficit during april and most of may due to restrained government spending rbi said that transmission of the cumulative reduction of 50 bps in the policy repo rate in february and april 2019 was 21 bps to the weighted average lending rate walr on fresh rupee loans interest rates on longer tenor money market instruments remained broadly aligned with the overnight weighted average call rate reflecting near full transmission of the reduction in policy rate the central bank lowered the policy rate by another 25 bps on june 6 making it the straight third rate cut in the year the central bank has also changed its stance to accommodative from neutral which means there would be no possibility of a rate hike in the near horizon more critically das said that the central bank would ensure adequate liquidity in the system for all productive purposes there are many options for the new committee the reserve banks mpc could be advised to look beyond the wacr to gauge the liquidity situation in the economy like major central banks mpc should look at the entire term structure of money market rates to gauge the efficacy of its liquidity stance said b prasanna head of global markets groups at  second rbi may ease the daily crr maintenance framework from the current 99 per cent compliance to 80 per cent or so this will be indirectly relaxing crr without officially cutting it this will improve the banking liquidity condition corporate bond yields in the secondary market in april and may were lower than the lending rate of banks indicative of the faster transmission of the rbi rate cuts in the bond markets corporate bond yields weighted average in the secondary markets were 9 bps lower than the banks marginal costbased lending rate mclr in april and 44 bps lower in may said care ratings the 10year government securities benchmark yield has also declined by about 56 basis points from its average in april 2019 to about 686 per cent the softening of bond yields in the secondary market and the consequent softening in the cost of borrowing in the primary market coincided with a rise in bond issuances prime database showed an 86 per cent monthly jump in volume to rs 45539 crore in may the weighted average cost of issuances in the primary market was 13 bps lower at 849 per cent compared to the monthago rate at the heart of the mismatch between the rbis policy and the banks failure to pass on the benefit to the borrowers is the slowdown in household savings deposit rates became soft in june as compared to the rates in april but they are not as soft as was expected by the regulator this is because small savings rates still remain elevated a correction is needed in small savings rates for better transmission of monetary policy said chief executive director ss mallikarjuna rao the transmission in lending rate was restricted merely to new loans the weighted average lending rate on outstanding rupee loans rose by 4 bps as past loans continue to be priced at high rates increased government borrowing and elevated small savings rates have rendered deposit mobilisation by banks expensive also indias consumption demand is still not a pronounced credit fuelled or leveraged demand sunil kumar sinha principal economist at india ratings and research said ahead of the third rate cut of the year the situation at the current juncture has become further complicated due to the crisis in both the banking and the nonbank sectors while banks are saddled with about 11 per cent of their loans turning bad nbfcs are struggling with solvency issues leading to credit freeze this creates a sense of dj vu easier fund flow in interbank system in the yesteryears has led to credit underwriting crisis more often than not rbi which is at the cusp of cleansing the banking sector balance sheet after a fouryear firefighting should not allow it go waste rbi may do well in harmonising the definition of liquidity and create a more effective communication channel among itself market players and the government the market often confuses between the liquidity availability with the willingness of entities to lend to one another which is an independent commercial

ICICI BANK,equity investors on dalal street are waiting for the full union budget to see if it contains what is needed to revive the domestic equity market and put it on a rising trajectory there are

time somehow the index is refusing to reflect the uncertainties like delayed monsoon and nbfc crisis or ongoing economic slowdown said raamdeo agrawal a market veteran and joint managing director at motilal oswal financial services the union budget is a very big event for the market as it will hold cues on what the government is planning to do over the next five years right now the market is ignoring good things in the economy and focusing only on the slowdown as an investor you should think about the next five years the strong political mandate for the government has a lot of meaning i am cautiously optimistic and remain invested in the market i would not wait too long for further clearance of the sky to decide my further allocation agrawal said speculation is rife that the government will address financial sector troubles like rising nonperforming assets and liquidity crisis in nbfcs which will in turn help lift consumption demand therefore there could be action in sectors like auto fmcg housing and building materials specific sectors which might benefit from this budget include healthcare or pharma banking fmcg and housing finance says arun thukral md  ceo axis securities any budget incentives to build the healthcare infrastructure will benefit the pharma sector there are also expectations of a roadmap for banking reforms including consolidation of the stateowned lenders to support the economy in the next phase of growth there is a high probability that this budget would see higher allocation for recapitalisation of psu banks this in turn will strengthen the banking sector thukral said based on these assumptions and various brokerage recommendations we collated a list of stocks that can potentially deliver healthy returns if the budget
