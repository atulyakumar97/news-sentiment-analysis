TATA STEEL,when paresh shah bought shares of tata steel  he had done so with a lot of conviction that the stock would eventually move up however after six months he found that despite all the pep talk from his broker and the rosy picture painted by analysts the stock was still trading below his purchase price what is more concerning is the fact that the stock was not even showing signs of momentum what can paresh do at this point in time frankly that is not too complicated tata steel represents a solid business from a reputed business group and has rewarded investors in the past paresh himself is convinced that the stock is a good investment and is willing to wait but waiting has a cost and that cost is in the form of lost opportunities can paresh make his investment productive in such a way that he at least earns some money even as he holds the stock of tata steel the answer could be a covered call but what exactly is a covered call strategy a covered call is a simple hybrid strategy of selling higher call options when you buy a call you get a right to buy without the obligation but when you sell a call you get the obligation to sell the stock without the right let us now get back to our illustration on tata steel paresh had bought tata steel at a price of rs 530 currently the stock is quoting at lets say rs 502 while it is a notional loss his funds have been locked up in tata steel for the last six months that is where a covered call would have helped in a covered call the investor holds on to the cash position in tata steel but keeps selling higher strike call options this is how a covered call strategy will look like when the spot price is rs 502 cash market trade call option trade buy tata steel 1061 shares at rs 530 sell 1 lot 530 strike call at rs 950 now there are three possible price outcomes in the above case  if the stock price remains below rs 530 then the entire option premium of rs 950 will come into pareshs account and reduce his cost of tata steel to rs 52050  if the stock price goes sharply lower then paresh still earns the premium of rs 950 but the notional loss on tata steel widens that is not a comfortable situation  if the stock price goes up to rs 560 then there is a loss on the short call but since he is long on the cash market position he has nothing much to really worry about using covered call to consistently reduce your cost of holding the stock in fact this is where the real power of a covered call is realised if the view is that tata steel will not breach above the rs 530 mark then each month paresh can earn the premium by selling the higher call since the option expires on the last thursday of the month each month he will have to write a fresh short call does that mean each month he will make a profit on the call not exactly in some months the price movement may not favour and paresh will have to book a loss let us look at a practical scenario of how this strategy will work over a period of six months where some months are good and some are bad the table below captures how the covered call would have panned out in the last 6 months by consistently selling higher calls for six months paresh would have made rs 1725 as net profit on selling calls that effectively reduces his cost of holding tata steel from rs 530 to rs 51275 at the current market price of rs 502 your mtm loss now looks a lot more justifiable that is the advantage that you get from a covered call strategy two very important precautions needed in a covered call while a covered call is a great strategy to reduce your cost and put your investment to work there are two important things that you need to keep in mind a some traders buy futures on the stock instead of a cash market position the risk is that if the stock price falls sharply then your call has limited profit but your mtm losses on the futures can mount b at no point should this strategy be closed as a single leg for example if the price goes up dont book profits on the cash market position and hold the short call you are not hedged and your losses can mount rapidly covered calls are simple to use and easy to understand in a volatile market like india these covered calls can be a good bet at least on predictable stocks with inherent strengths the author is chief analyst  technical  derivatives  angel broking,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/covered-calls-reduce-cost-holding-stock-4083801.html,492.5,11-06-2019,486.05,TATASTEEL,12:40,Here's how to use covered calls to reduce cost of holding a stock,moneycontrol

TATA STEEL,kolkata  mumbai and abandoned plans to merge their businesses in europe as they expect the deal to be blocked by the  tata steel fell 6 as it needs to look for another way to spin off the european steel unit and cut debt while the proposed jv was an important strategic initiative to create a sustainable portfolio help deconsolidate the european business and deleverage its balance sheet tata steel remains committed to the strategy and would explore all options to achieve similar outcomes in the future the company said tata steel europe had debt of 2 billion euro as on march 31 every option for tata steel europe will be considered and pursued tata steel ceo tv narendran said in reply to aquestion about a possible plan b the two companies had signed definitive agreements on june 30 2018 to create a 5050 jv the ec had raised concerns over high prices for electrical steel automotive steel and packaging among others in the event of the merger the companies announced they were scrapping the plan in official statements on friday thyssenkrupp said making further concessions over ec concerns would adversely affect the intended synergies of the merger adding the economic logic of the jv would no longer be valid tata steel added consequently with deep disappointment the partners assume that ec will not approve the  thyssenkrupp ceo guido kerkhoff said we very much regret the commissions decision we dont share their assessment from our point of view the joint venture would have been the strategically superior solution for steel it would not have posed a threat to competition since overcapacities and high import pressure from asia create difficult market conditions the european steel industry needs consolidation we are still convinced of this the companies had arrived at the merger plan to help arrest the slide in their faltering steel businesses in europe the german engineering giant had stated that steel was not core to its overall business tata steels european unit originated with its acquisition of corus in 2007 for 12 billion both companies had offered to sell assets in belgium spain and the uk to win antitrust approval but the commission didnt seem to be satisfied with the concessions offered by the two prospective partners tata steel which had proposed to transfer a debt of 25 billion euros to the joint venture fell 6 to rs 48730 on the bse on friday the sensex fell 026 markets are not in our control but performance in europe is better this year than last year when we had a number of operational issues in the uk and netherlands narendran said the impact on the consolidated tata steel business will be minimal he said when the european steelmaker was acquired it was four times the size of the india business indian operations now account for 6065 of the consolidated business he said thus the share of its european business and its impact on tata steel is far less now compared to when corus was acquired narendran said also the india business is well positioned to continue to enhance its earnings and cash flow performance levels from that achieved in 201819 he added tata steel cfo koushik chatterjee said while pursuing the end strategy for the european business in the near term tata steel will also continue to focus on its performance management to enhance its earnings and cash flows to build a selfsustaining future for the business it will continue to run its plants in the uk and in the netherlands and other areas in europe the plan to reduce debt wont change chatterjee said we have in the last sixeight months reduced our debt significantly from its peak level following the bhushan steel acquisition he said we have done more than our target of 1 billion we will focus more on deleveraging now tata steel will look at the sale of other assets in its portfolio consolidation of its portfolio and improve cash flows to accelerate its debt targets in line with its appetite for the future he said adding that the development wouldnt impact the companys borrowing costs tata steels debt stood at rs 1lakh crore on march 31 thyssenkrupps jv not materialising is a setback for tata steel said ritesh shah lead analyst for materials at investec india it will reduce the pace of deleveraging at the consolidated level given rs 19500 crore of debt gets back to its books instead of the jv and it would need to fund the europe cash drain its important to see how the company funds the european operations going forward and for how long the management has done a great job on the balance sheet debt maturity profile so far and we expect deleveraging to progress albeit at a slower pace thyssenkrupp said it will reintegrate the europe steel business in the third quarter of the current fiscal year adding that expected book equity gains from the joint venture will not materialise tata steel and thyssenkrupp had recently submitted a revised plan responding to the european authorities who sought concessions from the steel giants this came on top of the concessions that thyssenkrupp had offered in april the european commission had extended the deadline for reviewing the planned joint venture
